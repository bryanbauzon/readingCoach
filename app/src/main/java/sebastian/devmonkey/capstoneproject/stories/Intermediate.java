                    "He must leave for his work at the hospital soon."+
                    "Today is going to be very cold,' says the TV weatherman."+
                    "'Be sure to wear very warm clothes when you go outside."+
                    "Also, be careful driving on the roads. Snowfall will make them slippery."+
                    "In fact, if you can stay home today, do it!' Dr. James cannot stay home.\n\n"+
                    "Very sick people are waiting to see him at the hospital. He goes to his closet."+
                    "He takes out the warmest clothes he has."+
                    "He puts on a sweater, jacket, gloves, socks, boots, and a hat."+
                    "He opens his front door to go to work. A gust of cold air blows inside."+
                    "'Wow, it is very cold outside,' Dr. James says.\n"+
                    "He is from Miami and is not used to the cold. 'The weatherman was right!'"+
                    "Before he can drive to work, Dr. James must clear the snow off his car."+
                    "He does this very fast. He hops in the car. He shivers."+
                    "His neck feels especially cold. Dr. James drives slowly to work."+
                    "Everyone else is driving slowly, too. There is a lot of traffic on the road."+
                    "There are cars in front of and behind him.\n"+
                    "Suddenly, the cars in front of Dr. James come to a stop."+
                    "There has been an accident! Dr. James hurries from his car to check on the driver of the car that has swerved off the road."+

                    "We slipped on a patch of ice, the driver says.\n"+

                    "'That is not what I am talking about, maam."+
                    "What is wrong is that I do not understand how the robber got in and out.'\n"+

                    "The detective walks to the front door. He examines the latch."+
                    "'And since there are no marks or scratches, the robber"+
                    "definitely did not try to break the lock.'"+
                    "'I have no idea how he did it,' says a bothered Ms. Gervis.\n"+
                    "'It is a big mystery.' 'And you say the robber stole nothing else?' asks the detective.\n"+

                    "'They are mine to give away. They are not for someone to steal.'"+

            "Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809 in a log cabin in Kentucky."+
                    "A cabin is a small house"+
                    "made of wood. When he was seven years old, his family moved to Indiana."+
                    "In 1830, the family moved to Illinois."+
                    "As a boy, Abraham Lincoln loved books. He always borrowed books from his neighbors."+
                    "He read them for a short time and then took them back to their owners."+
                    "He grew very tall. He was 64 tall."+
                    "He weighed 180 pounds. Abraham Lincoln studied law in his free time."+
                    "He was also interested in politics. He ran"+
                    "for political office. He lost in 1832.\n\n"+
                    "Later, he was elected to the Illinois legislature 4 times in 1834,"+
                    "1836, 1838, and 1840. People in the legislature make the laws."+
                    "He became president of the United"+
                    "States in 1861. He was the 16th president of the U.S."+
                    "There was a war between the North and the South in the U.S. It was the Civil War."+
                    "Lincoln called men to fight for the North. The North won the war. There"+
                    "were slaves in the South. Slaves work for no money."+
                    "They must work. They are not free to do what they want. Lincoln set the slaves free in 1863."+
                    "He let them go so they did not have to be slaves anymore."+
                    "Lincoln is famous for that.",
            //AMAZON RAINFOREST
            "The Amazon is the worlds largest tropical rain forest."+
                    "It covers an area of nearly 2.8 million square miles,"+
                    "which is nearly the size of the continent of Australia."+
                    "The Amazon rain forest gets its life from the majestic Amazon River,"+
                    "the worlds second-largest river, which runs directly through the heart of the region."+
                    "The rain forest itself is simply the drainage basin for the river and its many tributaries."+
                    "The vast forest itself consists of four layers,"+
                    "each featuring its own ecosystems and specially adapted plants and animals.\n\n"+
                    "The forest floor is the lowest region."+
                    "Since only 2 percent of the sunlight filters through the top layers to the understory,"+
                    "very few plants grow here."+
                    "The forest floor, however, is rich with rotting vegetation and the bodies of dead organisms,"+
                    "which are quickly broken down into nutrients integrated into the soil.\n\n"+
                    "Tree roots stay close to these available nutrients, and decomposers,"+
                    "such as millipedes and earthworms, use these nutrients for food."+
                    "The understory is the layer above the forest floor.\n\n"+
                    "Much like the forest floor, only about 25 percent of the sunlight reaches this shadowy realm."+
                    "Many of the plants in the understory have large,"+
                    "broad leaves to collect as much sunlight as possible."+
                    "The understory is so thick that there is very little air movement.\n"+
                    "As a result, plants rely on insects and animals to pollinate their flowers.\n\n"+
                    "The layer above the understory is the canopy."+
                    "This is where much of the action in the rain forest occurs."+
                    "Many canopy leaves have specially adapted leaves which form drip tips.\n"+
                    "Drip tips allow water to flow off the leaves, which prevents mosses, fungi,"+
                    "and lichens from occupying the leaves. \n"+
                    "Leaves in the canopy are very dense and f'nilter about 80 percent of the sunlight."+
                    "The canopy is where the wealth of the rain forests fruits and flowers grow."+
                    "Bromeliads, cuplike plants,"+
                    "provide drinking pools for animals and breeding locations for tree frogs.\n\n"+
                    "The emergent layer is above the canopy and is the top layer of the rain forest."+
                    "Trees in the emergent layer break through the canopy and may reach heights of 200 feet."+
                    "Leaves in the emergent layer are small and covered with a special wax to hold water."+
                    "Seeds are blown to other parts of the forest."+
                    "Trees that rise to the emergent layer are massive."+
                    "Many are braced by huge buttress roots."+
                    "Trunks can be 16 feet in circumference."+
                    "Many animals that survive in the emergent layer never touch the ground.",
            //AMERICAN INDIAN NAMES
            "There are many understandings about American Indian names."+
                    "Crazy Horse, for example, was given his name because he was courageous,"+
                    "not because he was insane. Indian families had no last names."+
                    "The Sioux Indiana gave individuals three or four names.\n\n"+
                    "The first name, given at birth, showed the order of birth into the family."+
                    "Wenonah, for instance, meant 'firstborn daughter.'\n"+
                    "The second name, the honor name, which was given to the child by a medicine man,"+
                    "usually referred to the line character or great deeds of one of the childs ancestors."+
                    "When grown, the person was expected to live up to this name, otherwise,"+
                    "the person might not be called by it.\n"+
                    "The third name, the nickname, usually referred to something odd that the person had done."+
                    "It was hardly ever flattering.\n"+
                    "The fourth name, the deed name, was given by a war chief after the person accomplished some feat of extraordinary bravery."+
                    "The name might be that of a fear-inspiring animal such as Bear or Buffalo or that of a noble bird,"+
                    "such as Eagle, Hawk, or Owl.",
            //AMERICA'S FIRST SCUPTOR
            "Patience Wright was Americas first sculptor."+
                    "She was born in New Jersey in 1725."+
                    "As a child she made likenesses with bread dough of her family and friends."+
                    "She was married to a local farmer and experimented with wax figures."+
                    "Perhaps she was inspired by the popular travelling exhibits of wax images.\n\n"+
                    "At forty-four she was widowed. She decided to move to New York to start a wax works museum."+
                    "It was very successful people delighted in her wax figures of criminals and great people of history."+
                    "She then moved to London. She was successful there, too."+
                    "She even made wax portraits of the king and queen."+
                    "The American Revolution made her less popular, however."+
                    "She was supposed to have been a spy for Benjamin Franklin during the Revolution,"+
                    "sending him information in the wax heads of dolls. Again popular after the war, she died in 1786."+
                    "She wanted to be returned to her dear America, but she was buried in England.",
            //AMERICA'S FIRST WOMAN ARCHITECT
            "As a girl, Louisa Bethune showed great promise in planning houses and various other structures."+
                    "As an adult, she was determined to become Americas first woman architect."+
                    "Young architects then usually learned their skills by working in the drafting rooms of professional architects."+
                    "Most architects didnt want to employ women."+
                    "But Louise convinced a well-known architect to give her a chance."+
                    "She worked from six in the morning to six in the evening. She wasnt paid much."+
                    "But she learned as she worked, and her employer allowed her to use his large library.\n\n"+
                    "In 1881, after five years of work and study, Louise set up her own office."+
                    "She advertised that the first professional woman architect in the country was ready for business."+
                    "Louise insisted that she would not be limited to designing private homes just because she was a woman."+
                    "She sought out a variety of jobs and designed chapels, storage buildings, factories, and schools."+
                    "She did very well, inspiring other women to become architects."+
                    "She often spoke out for fair treatment for women and equal pay for equal work.",
            //ARCTIC FOX
            "The Arctic fox is a small fox found commonly in the arctic regions of the world."+
                    "Measuring a little less than three feet in length,"+
                    "this fox is mottled brown in the summer and pure white in the winter."+
                    "Adult foxes weigh between six and twenty pounds, though most are closer to six."+
                    "Its thick fur coat helps insulate it from the freezing temperatures and windswept snow."+
                    "The Arctic fox is the ultimate survivor."+
                    "It will eat just about anything including insects, small mammals, birds, ducks, geese, eggs, and even an occasional snowy owl."+
                    "\n\nLemmings, small mouse-like mammals, are its most common prey."+
                    "In fact, when populations of lemmings crash every three or four years,"+
                    "so do the populations of foxes."+
                    "Arctic foxes will eat berries and seaweed as well."+
                    "When food is scarce, Arctic foxes become scavengers."+
                    "The Arctic fox is sometimes preyed upon by polar bears."+
                    "Arctic fox vixens (female foxes) can give birth to as many as twenty-five kits (baby foxes) in the springtime (the largest of any carnivore)."+
                    "Most litters, however, contain between five and eight kits. Both male and female foxes help take care of the young. While the Arctic fox is common throughout much of the Arctic region, it is exceedingly rare in the Scandinavian nations of Norway, Sweden, and Finland, where populations never recovered from severe overhunting."+
                   "In addition, recent movements of the red fox into Arctic fox territory (probably as a result of global warming) threaten the Arctic fox population as well.",

            "The phone rang at Pratt Taylor’s house at nearly three in the morning. Pratt fumbled for the phone in the dark."+
                    "He answered groggily after the fourth ring. 'Hello,' Pratt mumbled into the receiver."+
                    "'Mr.Taylor. Thank goodness. I need your help.' Pratt knew the voice, for sure."+
                    "But still drowsy, he could not quite place it. 'Mr. Taylor!' the man said again in a raspy, loud whisper."+
                    "'I am in jail. I was allowed one phone call. I’m calling you.' Then, the fog cleared."+
                    "Although nearly ten years had passed since their last encounter, Pratt was able to discern something familiar in this voice."+
                    "It belonged to a boy named Martin'Hall, easily one of the most brilliant math students he had ever taught."+
                    "But while Pratt recalled that Martin possessed an enviable aptitude for math, he also had a knack for getting into trouble."+
                    "\n\nStill, they had forged a strong student-teacher bond, and when Martin graduated from Linebrook High School,Pratt had told him, 'Call me if there is anything you ever need."+
                    "'So here it was – the call in the middle of the night. 'Yes, Martin. Is that you?' 'Yes, Mr.Taylor. Can you help?' 'What do you need?' 'Bailmoney.'"+
                    "'What did you do?' 'We’ll talk about that later. Can you get me one thousand bucks?' Pratt knew he could, but he was hesitant."+
                    "What had Martin done? What was Pratt getting himself into? Pratt’s belief in honoring his word determined his decision."+
                    "'Yes, I can. Where shall I bring it?' 'I’m at Jessup in Maryland. My brother will come by your place in the morning."+
                    "Give the money to him, and he will come and bail me out.' 'Okay.' Upon hanging up the phone,."+
                    "Pratt was overcome by a dreadful feeling – his intuition told him that the decision to bail Martin out would be one that would vex him for a very, very long time.",

                    "Today, when a person earns money from their job,"+
                    "their paycheck is often electronically deposited (put) into their savings or checking account."+
                    "Then, he or she can pay their bills by writing checks from their checking accounts or pay online where their bills are electronically connected to their bank accounts."+
                    "\n\nBanks also give loans to people."+
                    "People may use the bank's money to buy new houses, cars,"+
                    "or to start businesses among other reasons."+
                    "The bank makes money from lending by charging interest."+
                    "In other words, people have to pay back more than they borrowed."+
                    "This amount depends on how risky the bank thinks the borrower is and how fast the loan is paid back among other things.",

            "Benjamin Franklin was born in 1706 in Boston, Massachusetts."+

                    "He worked for the newspaper for a short time, but he was not happy."+
                    "So, he went to Philadelphia and worked as a printer.\n\n"+

                    "The newspaper was the Pennsylvania Gazette."+

                    "This book came out every year. Almanacs have information about weather and crops."+
                    "They also have wise sayings."+

All 22 of those birds were captured and cared for in captivity that year for the purpose of saving the species from certain extinction. Although the condor was never common, populations of condors plummeted because of habitat destruction, pesticides, lead shot (which would contaminate carcasses), and electrical towers (which the birds would collide with). In a landmark effort, biologists from the San Diego Zoo initiated a captive breeding program with the condors and successfully increased their numbers to the point where some individuals could be re-released into the wild. Scientists took advantage of the condors tendency to double clutch, or lay another egg, if the first is lost or destroyed. Newly released condors have been trained to avoid electrical towers and"+ "people. In 2003, the first young condor fledged in the wild since 1981.
