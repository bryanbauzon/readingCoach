            "People at the nineteen-twelve Indianapolis 500 automobile race were certain that Ralph De Palma would win. He had led for most of the 500-mile (BM-kilometer) race. Only a disaster could stop him from winning.Then it happened. Going into the last lap, his car suddenly stopped. DePalma jumped out and began to push it.\n\nAs he pushed, cars whizzed by at speeds of 160 km/h (100 mph). But he did not seem to mind. He slowly made his war toward the finish line.\nDePalmas car crossed the line just before Joe Dawson, the man in second place, roared past. But the prize went to Dawson. There is a rule that the winning car has to cross the finish line under its own power. ",

            "Airplanes can do three things that airplanes cannot do. \n  First, when airplanes move upward, they must also move forward, but helicopters can move straight up without moving ahead. Second, helicopters can fly backward, which airplanes cannot do. Third, helicopters can use their rotors to hover in the air (stay in one place) which is impossible for planes. Because helicopters can perform actions that airplanes cannot, they are used for different tasks. Since helicopters can take off without moving forward, they do not need a runway for takeoff. They are used in congested areas where there is no room for airplanes or in isolated areas which do not have airports. Because they can hover, they are used on fire fighting missions to drop water on fires. They are used in logging operations to lift trees out of forests. Helicopters are used as air ambulances to airlift patients out of situations which are difficult to reach by conventional ambulances. The police use helicopters to follow suspects on the ground or to search for cars on the ground."+

            "A metaphor is a poetic device that deals with " +
                    "comparison. It compares similar qualities of two " +
                    "dissimilar objects. With a simple metaphor, one " +
                    "object becomes the other: Love is a rose. Although " +
                    "this does not sound like a particularly rich image, " +

                    "particular image that poets use them more than " +
                    "any other type of figurative language. The reason " +
                    "for this is that poets compose their poetry to " +
                    "express what they are experiencing emotionally " +
                    "at that moment. Consequently, what the poet " +
                    "imagines love to be may or may not be our perception " +
                    "of love. Therefore, the poet’s job is to " +
                    "enable us to experience it, to feel it the same way " +
                    "that the poet does. We should be able to nod in " +

                    "metaphor concerning love and the rose to " +
                    "see what it offers. Because the poet uses a comparison " +
                    "with a rose, first we must examine the " +
                    "characteristics of that flower. A rose is spectacular " +
                    "in its beauty, its petals are velvety soft, and its " +
                    "aroma is soothing and pleasing. It’s possible to " +
                    "say that a rose is actually a veritable feast to the " +
                    "senses: the visual, the tactile, and the aural [more " +
                    "commonly known as the senses of sight, touch, " +
                    "and sound]. The rose’s appearance seems to border " +

                    "in form. Isn’t this the way one’s love should " +

                    "another dimension added to the comparison by " +
                    "using a rose. Roses have thorns. This is the comprehensive " +
                    "image the poet wants to communicate; " +
                    "otherwise, a daisy or a mum would have " +
                    "been presented to the audience as the ultimate" +
                    "representation of love—but the poet didn’t, " +
                    "instead conveying the idea that roses can be " +
                    "treacherous. So can love, the metaphor tells us. " +

            "Today, bicycles are elegantly simple machines that " +

                    "bicycles for recreation, whereas others use them as " +
                    "a means of transportation. The first bicycle, called " +
                    "a draisienne, was invented in Germany in 1818 by " +
                    "Baron Karl de Drais de Sauerbrun. Because it was " +
                    "made of wood, the draisienne wasn’t very durable " +
                    "nor did it have pedals. Riders moved it by pushing " +
                    "their feet against the ground. " +
                    "In 1839, Kirkpatrick Macmillan, a Scottish " +
                    "blacksmith, invented a much better bicycle. " +
                    "Macmillan’s machine had tires with iron rims to " +
                    "keep them from getting worn down. He also used " +
                    "foot-operated cranks, similar to pedals, so his " +
                    "bicycle could be ridden at a quick pace. It didn’t " +
                    "look much like the modern bicycle, though, " +
                    "because its back wheel was substantially larger " +
                    "than its front wheel. Although Macmillan’s bicycles " +
                    "could be ridden easily, they were never produced " +
                    "in large numbers. " +
                    "In 1861, Frenchman Pierre Michaux and " +
                    "his brother Ernest invented a bicycle with an " +
                    "improved crank mechanism. They called their " +
                    "bicycle a vélocipède, but most people called it a " +
                    "“bone shaker” because of the jarring effect of " +
                    "the wood and iron frame. Despite the unflatterin " +
                    "nickname, the vélocipède was a hit. After a few " +
                    "years, the Michaux family was making hundreds " +
                    "of the machines annually, mostly for fun-seeking " +
                    "young people. " +
                    "Ten years later, James Starley, an English " +
                    "inventor, made several innovations that revolutionized " +
                    "bicycle design. He made the front wheel " +
                    "many times larger than the back wheel, put a gear " +
                    "on the pedals to make the bicycle more efficient, " +
                    "and lightened the wheels by using wire spokes. " +
                    "Although this bicycle was much lighter and less " +
                    "tiring to ride, it was still clumsy, extremely topheavy, " +
                    "and ridden mostly for entertainment. " +
                    "It wasn’t until 1874 that the first truly modern " +
                    "bicycle appeared on the scene. Invented by " +
                    "another Englishman, H.J. Lawson, the safety bicycle " +
                    "would look familiar to today’s cyclists. The " +
                    "safety bicycle had equal-sized wheels, which made " +
                    "it much less prone to toppling over. Lawson also " +
                    "attached a chain to the pedals to drive the rear " +
                    "wheel. By 1893, the safety bicycle had been further " +
                    "improved with air-filled rubber tires, a diamondshaped " +
                    "frame, and easy braking. With the " +
                    "improvements provided by Lawson, bicycles " +

                    "years old. Because greyhounds usually live to " +

            "The lives of the Ancient Greeks revolved around " +

                    "They believed that the world existed in  " +

                    "hatred; joy, then sorrow; war then peace; and so " +
                    "on. The Greeks believed that good eris occured " +
                    "when one held a balanced outlook on life and " +
                    "coped with problems as they arose. It was a kin " +
                    "of ease of living that came from trying to bring " +
                    "together the great opposing forces in nature. Bad " +
                    "eris was evident in the violent conditions that " +
                    "ruled men’s lives. Although these things were " +
                    "found in nature and sometimes could not be " +
                    "controlled, it was believed that bad eris occurred " +
