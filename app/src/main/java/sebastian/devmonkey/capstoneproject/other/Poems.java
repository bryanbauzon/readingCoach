But if beauty is wasted, the world loses it forever: If a beautiful person\n" + "doesn’t use his beauty, he destroys it. The person who would commit such a murderous outrage on\n" + "himself has no love in his heart for others.",
   "Oh, how I wish you were yourself! But, my love, your identity will only last as long as you’re alive.\n" + "You should make preparations in anticipation of your inevitable death and pass on your beautiful\n" + "appearance to someone else. That way, your beauty, which you’ve only borrowed, wouldn’t have to\n" + "end. Then, even after you died, your beautiful body would be renewed in your children. Who would\n" + "let such a beautiful house fall into disrepair when prudent maintenance might make it outlast the\n" + "stormy gusts of winter and the frustrating barrenness surrounding death? Only the most\n" + "irresponsible spender could do such a thing, you know, my dear love. You had a father—let your son\n" + "be able to say the same.",
   "As fast as you will decline, you could grow again just as fast, through one of your children. The youth\n" + "and vigor that you would pass on to a child now that you’re still young, you could call your own when\n" + "you’re no longer young. In marriage and childbirth lie wisdom, beauty, and reproduction. Without\n" + "them you have only foolishness, age, and the cold decay of death. If everyone thought like you, the\n" + "human race would end, and in sixty years there’d be no more world. Let the people who aren’t good\n" + "enough to preserve—the rough, ugly, poor people—die childless. Nature gave abundantly to the\n" + "people whom she endowed with beauty, and you should cherish her gifts by being generous with\n" + "them. Nature made you her stamp, to serve as a template for all human beauty. She meant for you\n" + "to make copies of yourself, so that the original—you—wouldn’t die.",
   "When I look at the clock and notice time ticking away, and see splendid day sink into hideous night;\n" + "when I see the violet wilt and curly black hair turn white with age; when I see tall trees that once\n" + "provided shade for herds now barren of leaves, and the summer’s crops tied up and hauled to the\n" + "barn as if summer itself were an old man being carried off to his grave—then I have doubts about\n" + "the fate of your beauty, since you too will have to undergo the ravages of time. Sweet and beautiful\n" + "creatures don’t stay that way; they die as fast as they see others grow. And there’s no defense\n" + "against Time’s destructive power, except perhaps to have children—to defy Time when he takes you\n" + "away.",

  "I don’t base my judgments on the stars, and yet it does seem to me I know astrology. I can’t foresee\n" + "good or bad events—predict plagues, famines, or what a season will be like. Nor can I predict down\n" + "to the minute what each person’s misfortunes are going to be. Nor can I tell princes whether things\n" + "will go well for them by looking at the heavens. But I can forecast the future by looking in your eyes. I\n" + "see by those reliable guides that truth and beauty will thrive if you would only pass your attributes on\n" + "to a child. Otherwise, this is what I predict: When you die, truth and beauty will die with you.",
  "When I think about the fact that every living thing is perfect only for a brief time, that the whole world\n" + "is one big stage on which the stars secretly control the action; when I see that men grow like plants,\n" + "encouraged and then thwarted by the same sky, exulting in their youthful vigor and then declining\n" + "just when they’re at their height, vanishing until their glory is no longer even remembered; when I\n" + "think about the whole world’s instability—then I think of you, a youth enjoying so many of nature’s\n" + "rich gifts. In my mind, I see time and decay debating with each other about how to corrupt your\n" + "sunny youth, how to convert it to old age and night. Out of love for you, I wage war against time: As\n" + "he takes away your youth, I continually recreate you in these poems.",
    "But why not take advantage of a stronger way to fight against this bloody tyrant, Time, and\n" + "strengthen yourself in your old age in a happier way than with my useless sonnets? Now your\n" + "capacity for pleasure is at its peak, and many virtuous maidens would love to marry you and bear\n" + "your children, who would recreate your image much better than any artificial reproduction such as a\n" + "painting or poem. The faces of your children will renew your life. Time created you and brought you\n" + "to your present state of perfection, but it cannot preserve your inner worth or outer beauty, and\n" + "neither can my poetry. Having a baby would preserve your image and ensure that you live on by\n" + "your own design.",
 "Who in the future will ever believe my poetry if I praise you as you deserve? Though, I have to admit,\n" + "my poetry is like a tomb that actually hides what you are really like and doesn’t manage to show\n" + "even half of your true qualities. If I could capture in my writing how beautiful your eyes are and\n" + "create new verses to list all of your wonderful attributes, decades from now people would say, “This\n" + "poet lies. No human face was ever so divine.” In this way, my poems (yellowed with age), would be\n" + "scorned, like old men who talk too much without saying anything true, and what is really your due\n" + "would be dismissed as a poet’s madness, the false verses of an old song. But if some child of yours\n" + "were still alive then, you would live twice: in the child, and in my poetry.",
    "Shall I compare you to a summer day? You’re lovelier and milder. Rough winds shake the pretty\n" + "buds of May, and summer doesn’t last nearly long enough. Sometimes the sun shines too hot, and\n" + "often its golden face is darkened by clouds. And everything beautiful stops being beautiful, either by\n" + "accident or simply in the course of nature. But your eternal summer will never fade, nor will you lose\n" + "possession of your beauty, nor shall death brag that you are wandering in the underworld, once\n" + "you’re captured in my eternal verses. As long as men are alive and have eyes with which to see, this\n" + "poem will live and keep you alive.",
    "Devouring Time, go ahead and blunt the lion’s paws. Make the earth swallow up her own creatures.\n" + "Pluck the sharp teeth out of the fierce tiger’s jaws, and burn the long-lived phoenix in its own blood.\n" + "Make happy and sad times as you fly by, and do whatever you want, swift-footed Time, to the wide\n" + "world and all its vanishing delights. But I forbid you to commit one heinous crime. Oh, don’t carve\n" + "wrinkles into my love’s beautiful forehead, and don’t draw lines there with your old pen. Let him pass\n" + "through time untainted, to serve as the model of beauty for men to come. But do your worst, old\n" + "Time. Despite your wrongs, my love will stay young forever in my poetry.",
     "Your face is as pretty as a woman’s, but you don’t even have to use makeup—you, the man (or\n" + "should I say woman?) I love. Your heart is as gentle as a woman’s, but it isn’t cheating like theirs.\n" + "Your eyes are prettier than women’s, but not as roving—you bless everything you look at. You’ve got\n" + "the good looks of a handsome man, but you attract both women and men. When Mother Nature\n" + "made you, she originally intended to make you a woman, but then she got carried away with her\n" + "creation and screwed me by adding a certainthing that I have no use for. But since she gave you a\n" + "prick to please women, I’ll keep your love, and they can enjoy your body.",
   "I’m not like that other poet iwho writes about a woman who’s pretty because she wears a lot of\n" + "makeup. In his verses, he compares her to heaven itself, and to every other beautiful thing—the sun\n" + "and moon, the rich gems of earth and sea, the first flowers of April, and all the rest of the precious\n" + "things on the face of the earth. Since I reallyam in love, I just want to write the truth, and when I do,\n" + "believe me—my lover is as beautiful as any human being, though maybe not as bright as the stars.\n" + "Whoever actually likes those love-poem clichés can say more; I’m not trying to sell anything, so I\n" + "won’t waste time with praise.",
   "I won’t believe my mirror when it tells me I’m old, as long as you’re still young. But when I see you\n" + "with wrinkles, then I’ll know death is on its way, because your beauty is as close to my heart as\n" + "beautiful clothing to a body. Put another way, my heart beats in your chest and yours in mine. But if\n" + "that’s true, then how can I be older than you? Therefore, my love, take care of yourself just as I will\n" + "take care of myself, not for my own sake, but because I have your heart inside of me, which I will\n" + "protect as carefully as a nurse her baby. Don’t expect to get your heart back from me when mine is\n" + "dead. You gave it to me forever, never to be returned.",
   "Like an actor who hasn’t learned his lines perfectly and forgets his part because of stage fright, or\n" + "like some raging animal or human whose excessive passion makes it weak, so I, because I can’t\n" + "trust myself, forget to say the things a lover should say to his darling; just when my love is strongest\n" + "it seems to be getting weak. So let my writings speak for my heart instead. They plead for love better\n" + "than I could if I spoke, even if I said more and more eloquently. Oh, read in these silent lines the love\n" + "I cannot express in speech. Love will give you the insight to read between the lines.",
    "Mine eye hath played the painter and hath steeled\n" + "Thy beauty’s form in table of my heart.\n" + "My body is the frame wherein ’tis held,\n" + "And pérspective it is best painter’s art.\n" + "For through the painter must you see his skill\n" + "To find where your true image pictured lies,\n" + "Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,\n" + "That hath his windows glazèd with thine eyes.\n" + "Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:\n" + "Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\n" + "Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun\n" + "Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.\n" + "Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;\n" + "They draw but what they see, know not the heart",
    "Let fortunate people boast about their prizes and their titles, while I—who am not lucky enough to\n" + "get such rewards—experience unexpected joy in what I honor most: your love. Those courtiers who\n" + "enjoy high status because they’re the favorites of great princes are like marigolds. They bloom as\n" + "long as the sun shines on them, but their pride is fragile—one frown will kill them. And once a\n" + "famous warrior who has painfully endured and won a thousand battles is defeated, he’s stripped of\n" + "all his honors, and all of the successes that he worked for are forgotten. How much happier am I,\n" + "who love and am loved in a place I cannot leave and from which others cannot remove me.",
   "My love, I am your absolute servant; your worth compels me to serve you loyally. I’m sending you\n" + "this message to show my devotion to you, not to show that I can write well. My skills are so poor that\n" + "I may make my obligation to you, which is great, seem meager. I don’t have the words to express it\n" + "properly. But I hope that in your heart you’ll form an idea of what I mean and the idea will enrich your\n" + "sense of what I owe you. When the star that guides me shines on me favorably, giving me the\n" + "inspiration to dress up my tattered love for you in clever words that prove I’m worthy of your sweet\n" + "respect—that’s when I’ll dare to boast about how much I love you. Until then, I won’t show my face\n" + "anywhere that you can put me to the test.",
   "Weary from work, I hasten to my bed, the sweet place of rest for a body tired out from laboring. But\n" + "then I start to go on a journey in my head, making my mind work after my body’s work is finished.\n" + "Because when I go to bed, my thoughts begin the trip from where I am, far away from you, to where\n" + "you are. They keep my weary eyes wide open, staring at the darkness like blind people do. Except,\n" + "in my imagination, I see your image, though it’s too dark to see anything else. Like a shining jewel\n" + "hanging in the terrifying night, your image makes that old, black night look beautiful and young. See,\n" + "because of you, my body does not rest in the daytime and my mind finds no peace at night.",
   "So how can I return in a cheerful state of mind when I’m prevented from getting any rest? When the\n" + "oppression I experience during the day isn’t relieved by any sleep at night, but instead my sleepless\n" + "nights oppress me during the day and my wearisome days oppress me at night? And though day\n" + "and night are natural enemies, they’ve shook hands and made a bargain to both torture me, the day\n" + "with labor, the night with thoughts of how far away you are as I labor over thoughts of you. I try to\n" + "please the day by telling him how bright you are—so bright that you take the sun’s place when\n" + "clouds cover the sky. In the same way, I use you to flatter black night, telling him how you brighten\n" + "the evening sky when stars don’t shine. But they both—day and night—only prolong my sorrows,\n" + "and night by night this prolonged grief grows stronger.",
   "When I’m in disgrace with everyone and my luck has deserted me, I sit all alone and cry about the\n" + "fact that I’m an outcast, and bother God with useless cries, which fall on deaf ears, and look at\n" + "myself and curse my fate, wishing that I had more to hope for, wishing I had this man’s good looks\n" + "and that man’s friends, this man’s skills and that man’s opportunities, and totally dissatisfied with the\n" + "things I usually enjoy the most. Yet, as I’m thinking these thoughts and almost hating myself, I\n" + "happen to think about you, and then my condition improves—like a lark at daybreak rising up and\n" + "leaving the earth far behind to sing hymns to God. For when I remember your sweet love, I feel so\n" + "wealthy that I’d refuse to change places even with kings.",
  "When I sit alone in silence and remember the past, I get depressed about all the things I don’t have\n" + "that I once strived for, and I add to old griefs new tears for all the valuable time I’ve wasted. Then I\n" + "can drown my eyes, which are not usually wet from crying, in tears for precious friends who are\n" + "dead, and I can weep again for hurts in loves that are long since over and moan about the loss of\n" + "many things I’ll never see again. Then I can grieve about grievances I had let go of and sadly\n" + "recount each woe that I’d already cried about in the past, feeling the pain all over again, as if I hadn’t\n" + "suffered over these things already. But if I think about you, my dear friend, while I’m doing all of this,\n" + "I get back everything I’d lost, and all my sorrows end.",
   "You have the love of everyone who used to love me, people who I supposed were dead because I\n" + "didn’t have their love anymore. Love reigns in your heart—both everything belonging to love and all\n" + "those friends who I thought were dead and buried. How many tears of devoted love have I shed at\n" + "funerals, in payment to the dead, when now it appears they had only gone to hide in your heart.\n" + "You’re like a grave where dead lovers come alive again, decorated with mementos of those lost\n" + "loves who gave you all the love I owed to each of them. All the love I owed to many is now yours\n" + "alone. I see these lovers in you, and you, who contain everyone I have ever loved or was loved by,\n" + "have all of me.",
   "If you survive me, living on after dust covers my bones, and you should happen to read over again\n" + "these poor, crude sonnets written by the man who once loved you, remember that things have\n" + "improved since my day. So even though any poet today could write better sonnets, keep my poems\n" + "for the sake of my love, not for my skill, which luckier men have far surpassed. And grant me this\n" + "loving thought: “If my friend’s inspiration was paired with the advantages today’s poets have, his love\n" + "would have brought forth better poems than these, to rank alongside those of today’s better poets.\n" +"But since he died, and poets are better now, I’ll read their poems for their style, his for his love.”",
    "I’ve seen many beautiful mornings in which the sun beautifies the mountaintops, kissing the\n" + "green meadows with its golden face and making streams sparkle as if by magic. But then it\n" + "suddenly permits the nastiest clouds to ride across its heavenly face, and it hides from the\n" + "forlorn world, sneaking off to the west in disgrace. In exactly this way, early one morning my\n" + "sun shone on my face with triumphant splendor, but alas he was only mine for one hour. The\n" + "clouds have hidden him from me now. But I don’t fault him for this at all. Golden men like him\n" + "can disgrace themselves as much as the real sun does.",
"Sun, why did you make it look like today was going to be such a beautiful day, so that I went out\n" + "without my cloak, only to let nasty clouds overtake me on my way, hiding your radiance behind their\n" + "poisonous mist? It’s not enough that you broke through the clouds and dried the rain off my storm-\n" + "beaten face, because no man can be satisfied with a cure that heals the physical injury but doesn’t\n" + "take away the disgrace. Nor does it comfort me that you’re ashamed, because even though you\n" + "regret what you did, I have still lost out. When someone takes something away from you, their being\n" + "sorry doesn’t help much. Ah, but those tears you’re shedding out of love for me are like pearls—very\n" + "valuable ones—and they make up for all your bad deeds.",
  "Don’t be upset anymore about what you did. Everything has its bad side: Roses have thorns,\n" + "sparkling fountains have mud, the sun and the moon are periodically covered up by clouds and\n" + "eclipses, and disgusting worms live in the sweetest flowers. All men do bad things—even me, right\n" + "now: As I excuse your transgression by comparing it to other things, I corrupt myself by making\n" + "excuses for your misdeeds (more excuses for these little sins than they even require). Because what\n" + "I’m doing is taking your sins, which were just physical urges, and putting my mind to work on their\n" + "behalf. The person you’ve hurt is now advocating for you—I’m now pleading the case against\n" + "myself. I’m so conflicted between love and hate that I can’t resist helping that sweet villain who\n" + "bitterly injures me every hour.",
  "I acknowledge that the two of us have to part, even though we’re united in love. That way I can take\n" + "those disgraces that we’ve incurred together all onto myself, bearing them without any help from\n" + "you. Our love for one another gives us common cause, despite this awful situation that forces us\n" + "apart, which, though it can’t prevent us from being united in love, still robs us of sweet hours of\n" + "pleasure together. I can never greet you openly again, because my guilt would bring shame upon\n" + "you. Nor can you ever honor me with public kindness without dishonoring your own reputation. But\n" + "don’t do that. I love you so much that I value your good reputation as my own.",
  "Just as a decrepit father takes pleasure in seeing his active child engaging in youthful activities, so I,\n" + "whom misfortune has injured and crippled, take all the comfort I can in your good worth and fidelity.\n" + "For whether beauty, nobility, wealth, and intelligence—or any one of these, or all of them, or more\n" + "than these—are your princely attributes, I’m attaching my love to them. I’m not lame, poor, or\n" + "despised, as long as this fantasy of mine lets me take so much satisfaction in your good luck and I\n" + "can live off part of your glory. Whatever is best, that’s what I wish you to have. Since I have this\n" + "wish, I’m lucky ten times over.",
    "How could I lack things to write about while you’re alive? You pour inspiration into my poetry by\n" + "giving me the sweetest subject to write about: yourself—too excellent a subject for ordinary writers to\n" + "describe. Oh, give yourself the credit if you see anything in my writing that’s worth reading. For who\n" + "is so speechless that he can’t write to you, when you yourself provide the creative spark? You\n" + "should be the tenth muse, worth ten times more than those other nine invoked by poets. And\n" + "whoever calls on you for inspiration, let him write eternal verses, to outlive even the farthest reaches\n" + "of time. If my little bit of inspiration happens to please today’s demanding readers, the painful work\n" + "can be mine, but the praise shall be yours.",
  "How can I celebrate your worth in my poems without appearing conceited, given that you’re my\n" + "better half? What good does it do me to praise myself—and am I doing anything besides praising\n" + "myself when I praise you? For this reason, let’s live apart. And though we love each other dearly,\n" + "let’s lose our common identity; by this separation, I can give you the praise that you deserve by\n" + "yourself. Oh, absence, you would be such a torment if it weren’t for the fact that you give me the\n" + "chance to fill up the lonely hours with thoughts of love, which make the time pass so sweetly, and\n" + "that you teach me how to divide my love and me in two, as I, here, praise my friend while he remains\n" + "elsewhere.",
"Take all my loves, my love—yes, take them all: Take my love for you, take away your love for me,\n" + "and take a lover from me. What do you have now that you didn’t have before? My love, you haven’t\n" + "acquired true love, because my true love was yours to begin with, before you took this extra from\n" + "me. If, instead of accepting my love, you make love to the person, love, I can’t blame you, because\n" + "you’re only taking advantage of my love. But, you should be blamed if you deceive yourself by taking\n" + "from one person what you won’t take from another—if you willingly make love to one person while\n" + "refusing to make love to me. I forgive you for stealing from me, gentle thief, although you’re taking\n" + "the little I have. And yet every lover knows that it hurts more to be injured by a lover than by an\n" + "enemy. You, who are gracious even when succumbing to lust, you in whom everything bad looks\n" + "good—even if you kill me with injuries, let’s not become enemies.",
   "Those charming little infidelities that you commit when I’m away from you for awhile are\n" + "understandable given your youth and beauty, since you’re continually tempted wherever you go.\n" + "You’re noble and distinguished, so women see you as a prize catch. You’re beautiful, and therefore\n" + "women pursue you aggressively. And when a woman is the pursuer, what man will rudely refuse her\n" + "to get his point across? But, oh my—you might at least stay away from my mistress and keep your\n" + "beauty and youthful urges in line, as they’re leading you into debauchery, which breaks two bonds:\n" + "my mistress’s fidelity to me, which your beauty tempts her to break, and your bond with me, which\n" + "your beauty, again, lets you break.",
 "The fact that you now have my mistress isn’t the only reason I’m hurt, though it’s true that I loved her\n" + "dearly. What makes me cry the most is that now she has you, a loss of love that hurts me even\n" + "more. You two criminals in love, here’s how I’ll rationalize the pain you’ve caused me: You, friend,\n" + "love her because you know I love her. And she loves you for the exact same reason, putting up with\n" + "your praises and lovemaking for my sake, because she knows you’re my friend. If I lose you, it’s a\n" + "win for my mistress. And if I lose her, you will have found what I’ve lost. Both of the people I love find\n" + "each other, and I lose them both, and both cause me this pain. But here’s what makes me happy:\n" + "My friend and I are one person. How gratifying!—It turns out my mistress loves only me.",
  "My eyes work best when I’m asleep, because all day they look at things I don’t care about. When I\n" + "sleep, my dreaming eyes alight on you and glitter brightly in the dark, having found your bright image\n" + "there. Given that your shadowy dream-image brightens even the dark, how bright might you appear\n" + "in daylight, when your own light is so much clearer? How bright, when your shadow shines so\n" + "brightly to my eyes blinded by darkness? What good would it do my eyes to see you in the daytime\n" + "when they already look at your beautiful image in the dead of night, as I sleep? Every day is as dark\n" + "as night until I get to see you again, and every night is as bright as day when I see you in my\n" + "dreams.",
  "If I were made of thought instead of slow, dull flesh, this wicked distance between us wouldn’t\n" + "keep me from where I wanted to be. No matter the distance—from the farthest possible\n" + "regions—I would bring myself to where you are. It wouldn’t matter that my feet were standing\n" + "on the spot on earth farthest from you: Thought is nimble enough to jump over both sea and\n" + "land as quickly as it can think about the place it wants to be. But, ah, it’s killing me to think that\n" + "I’m not made of thought and can’t leap over the many miles when you are gone. Instead my\n" + "body is made of so much earth and water that I have to fill the long time without you with my\n" + "moans. The leaden, deep earth and slow, wet water of which I am made give me nothing but\n" + "heavy tears.",
   "The other two elements, weightless air and purifying fire, both remain with you, wherever I\n" + "may be. Air is my thoughts, and fire is my desire. The two of them slide back and forth between\n" + "us swiftly and effortlessly. Normally I am made up of all four elements, but when my air and fire\n" + "are off on their errand of love to you, I sink into depression and slide toward death, until air and\n" + "fire return to restore the proper balance within me. Even now, they have returned from you to\n" + "tell me that you’re well and in good health. I rejoice to hear this but then immediately grow\n" + "gloomy from missing you, so I send them back to you and immediately grow sad again.",
  "My eye and my heart have gone to war with each other. They’re fighting over who gets to control\n" + "your image. My eye wants to bar my heart from the image that it formed, while my heart wants to\n" + "keep my eye away fromits image. My heart insists that your image lies safely hidden inside of him,\n" + "protected from eyes, which give everything away. But my eye, the defendant, denies the charges\n" + "and argues that your beauty resides in him. To decide whose claim is right, I have assembled a jury\n" + "consisting of my thoughts, all of which owe allegiance to the heart. And they have delivered a verdict\n" + "to determine which portion of your image belongs to the eyes and which precious portion to the\n" + "heart. This is what they say: My eyes have the rights to your outward appearance, and my heart has\n" + "the right to love you and be loved by you.",
  "My eye and my heart have reached an agreement, and now each does the other favors. When my\n" + "eye is starving to take a look at you or my heart smothers itself with sighs of love for you, then my\n" + "eye feasts on a painting of you and invites my heart to join in the banquet and stare at the painting\n" + "too. On another occasion, my eye is the guest with whom my heart shares some of his thoughts of\n" + "love. So when you are gone, you’re still present with me, either through your painting or in my love\n" + "for you: You can’t travel farther than my thoughts, and I’m always with them, and they are always\n" + "with you. Even if my thoughts go to sleep, your painting will wake up my heart and delight both heart\n" +"and eyes.",
  "I used to be so careful when I’d travel to secure all my trivial possessions with the most reliable locks\n" + "available so criminals wouldn’t tamper with them. But you, so much more precious than my jewels\n" + "and my greatest comfort, have become my greatest sadness and worry, because you’re vulnerable\n" + "to any common thief. I haven’t locked you up in any chest, other than in my own chest, where my\n" + "heart is, and you’re not really there, even though I feel that you are. You can come and go from my\n" + "heart as you please, and I’m afraid you’ll be stolen from there, because even an honest man would\n" + "turn thief to get such a rich prize.",
   "In anticipation of the time, if it ever comes, when I will see you frown at my defects; when mature\n" + "reflection tells you that you’ve come to the end of your love for me; in anticipation of that time when\n" + "you will pass by me like a stranger, barely even acknowledging me with a glance of your brilliant\n" + "eye; when your love for me isn’t love anymore and you’re guided only by somber judgment—in\n" + "anticipation of that time, I’m establishing myself here, knowing how little I really deserve, and I’m\n" + "giving testimony against myself to defend the justice of your future actions. You have every right to\n" + "leave poor me—all the laws of reason back you up—since I can’t offer any justification for your\n" + "loving me.",
   "I feel very depressed as I go on my journey, because I know when I get where I’m going I’ll have\n" + "time and leisure to rest, and when I have that time to rest I’ll have nothing to think about except “I’m\n" + "this many miles away from my friend.” The horse that carries me, affected by my sadness, plods\n" + "slowly on, bearing the weight of my emotions, as if by some instinct the poor creature knew that I\n" + "didn’t want to move quickly away from you. I can’t provoke him to go any faster with the bloody spur\n" + "that I sometimes thrust into his hide in anger. He only answers me with a groan, which hurts me\n" + "more than my spur hurts him, because it reminds me that my grief lies ahead of me and all my joy is\n" + "behind me.",
    "This is how my love for you excuses my horse’s slow plod as I journey away from you: “Why should I\n" + "hurry away from you?” Until I return, there’s no need to rush. But what excuse will my poor horse\n" + "have for his slowness then, when even the most extreme swiftness will seem slow to me? On the\n" + "return journey, I’d use my spurs even if the animal rode like the wind. Even if my horse had wings I’d\n" + "feel like we were standing still. No horse could keep up with my desire then. My desire, made of the\n" + "most perfect love, will race toward you like a horse made of fire, not neigh like a slow, dull horse\n" + "made of flesh and blood. But, my love, out of love I’ll excuse my horse like this: Since he deliberately\n" + "went slowly as he was leaving you, I’ll run back to you and forget about the horse altogether.",
  "I’m like a rich man who has the key to a great treasure chest, but who resists opening it every hour,\n" + "because he doesn’t want to spoil his pleasure by getting too used to the treasure. That’s why holiday\n" + "feasts are so infrequent: Spaced out across the year, they’re like precious jewels placed evenly\n" + "across a crown. In the same way, the time that keeps us apart is my treasure chest, or it’s like a\n" + "closet that hides a beautiful robe— the closet makes a special occasion even more special when it is\n" + "opened to reveal its hidden splendor. You are blessed with such great worth that those who are with\n" + "you feel triumphant, and those who are not with you hope to be."};
