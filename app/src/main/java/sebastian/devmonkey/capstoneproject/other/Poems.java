    public String[]  sonnet1={ "We want the most beautiful people to have children,\n" + "so their beauty will be preserved forever—when\n" + "the parent dies, the child he leaves behind will remind us of his beauty. But you, in love with your\n" + "own pretty eyes, are letting your beauty burn itself out. You’re starving the world of your beauty\n" + "rather than spreading the wealth around. You’re acting like your own worst enemy! Right now you’re\n" + "the best-looking thing in the world, the only person as beautiful as springtime. But your beauty is like\n" + "a new bud, and you’re letting it die before it can develop and bring you true happiness. You’re a\n" + "young man, but you act like an old miser—you’re wasting your beauty by hoarding it and keeping it\n" + "to yourself! Take pity on the rest of us, or this is how you’ll be remembered: as the greedy pig who\n" + "hogged his own beauty and took it with him to the grave." };
    public String[]  sonnet2 = {"When forty years have gone by and carved deep wrinkles in your forehead, your youthful beauty,\n" + "which everyone likes to look at now, will be worth little. Then, when someone asks you where all\n" + "your beauty is—all the treasure of your virile youth—if you were to say that it’s all there in your\n" + "withered face and sunken eyes, that would be an all-consuming shame and nothing to be proud of.\n" + "You’d have a much better excuse if, decades from now, you could say you spent your beauty and\n" + "youth raising a child. If someone were to ask you why you looked so old, you could say, “The effort I\n" + "spent raising this beautiful child explains the sorry old state I’m in”—and meanwhile your child’s\n" + "beauty would be a new incarnation of your own! Having a beautiful child would be like being born\n" + "again in old age, with the blood that flows coldly in your old veins becoming warm again in his."};
    public String[]  sonnet3 = {"Look in your mirror and tell the face you see that it’s time to father a child. Your face is fresh and\n" + "healthy now, but if you don’t reproduce it, you’ll be cheating the world and cursing a woman who\n" + "would happily be your child’s mother. After all, do you think there’s a woman out there so beautiful\n" + "that she’d refuse to have your child? And what man would be so foolish as to allow his own self-\n" + "absorption to stop himself from fathering children? You are like a mirror to your own mother, and\n" + "when she looks at you she can gaze back at the lovely springtime of her youth. In the same way,\n" + "when you are old and wrinkled, you’ll be able to look at your child and see yourself in your prime. But\n" + "if you choose not to have a child to remember you, you’ll die alone and leave no memory of your\n" + "own image."};
    public String[]  sonnet4 = {"You wasteful lovely person, why are you spending all of your beauty on yourself? Nature doesn’t\n" + "give us anything; she only lends us the gifts we get at birth, and, being generous herself, she lends\n" + "the most to people who are generous themselves. So, you beautiful miser, why do you abuse the\n" + "bountiful gifts that were given to you to share with others? Why do you insist on being such a bad\n" + "investor, using up the immense treasure you have to offer the world but unable to support yourself or\n" + "preserve your memory? By only having dealings with yourself, you’re cheating yourself out of the\n" + "best part of yourself. Then how, when nature says it’s time for you to go, will you be able to give an\n" + "acceptable account of how you spent your time and beauty? Your unused beauty will have to be\n" + "buried with you. But if you used that beauty now, it would stay behind once you were gone and\n" + "preserve your legacy."};
    public String[]  sonnet5 = {"The same process that over time shaped your wonderful face, so that now everybody loves to look\n" + "at you, will eventually destroy that face, making ugly what is now surpassingly beautiful. For never-\n" + "resting Time takes summer by the hand, leads him into horrifying winter, and destroys him\n" + "there—freezing his sap, removing his full leaves, covering up his beauty with snow, and turning\n" + "everything bare. If we didn’t have perfume distilled from summer flowers to keep in a jar, the effects\n" + "of summer would vanish at the end of the season. Without perfume, we’d have no way of\n" + "remembering the summer itself or its beauty. But the flowers used to make perfume lose only their\n" + "outward beauty when winter comes; their beautiful scent lives on sweetly."};
    public String[]  sonnet6 = {"So don’t let wintry old age destroy your summer beauty before your essence has been preserved.\n" + "Make some woman pregnant and pass on your beauty before it dies with you. It’s unfair to charge\n" + "exorbitant interest on a loan. But if you lend a woman your body, she’ll be only too happy to pay you\n" + "back with a child. Having a child—making another version of yourself—will make you happy. Having\n" + "ten children will make you ten times as happy. What power would death have over you if you left\n" + "children behind to keep your legacy alive? Don’t be willful and selfish—you’re much too beautiful to\n" + "be conquered by death, with nothing left of you but a corpse devoured by worms."};
    public String[]  sonnet7 = {"When the gracious light of the sun rises in the east, each person on earth pays homage to it by\n" + "gazing upon all its sacred majesty. And even at noon, once the sun has climbed the steep path to\n" + "the top of the sky, it still looks like a strong young man in his prime and human beings still adore its\n" + "beauty, watching it pass on its way like a golden king making a pilgrimage. But when the sun grows\n" + "weary and falls from its highest point, it reels like an old man, and the people who once looked up at\n" + "it so dutifully stop looking and turn the other way. In the same way, you, wasting your sexual energy\n" + "in the prime of your life, will die alone and unloved unless you father a son."};
    public String[]  sonnet8 = {"You’re like music to listen to, so why does listening to music make you sad? Delightful and joyful\n" + "things should complement one another. So why do you love things that make you unhappy and\n" + "enjoy things that are bad for you? If music played well and in tune sounds bad to you, it’s because\n" + "that music is rebuking you for not playing your own part—not making your own harmony—by getting\n" + "married and having children. Notice how the sound of two strings vibrating together in harmony is\n" + "like a father and child and happy mother, who all sing one pleasing note together. Though their\n" + "music has no words, the unity of their voices sings this warning to you: If you stay single, you’ll be a\n" + "childless nobody."};
    public String[]  sonnet9 = {"Are you eating up your own life by remaining single because you’re afraid your widow will cry when\n" + "you die? Ah, if you happen to die childless, the entire world will mourn for you like a wife who’s lost\n" + "her husband. The world will be your widow and weep forever about the fact that you didn’t leave a\n" + "copy of yourself. But if you had left a wife behind, she’d have had her children to look at and remind\n" + "her of her husband. A person who wastes his money is just shifting money around—at least the\n" + "money’s still in the world. But if beauty is wasted, the world loses it forever: If a beautiful person\n" + "doesn’t use his beauty, he destroys it. The person who would commit such a murderous outrage on\n" + "himself has no love in his heart for others."};
    public String[]  sonnet10 = {"Oh, how I wish you were yourself! But, my love, your identity will only last as long as you’re alive.\n" + "You should make preparations in anticipation of your inevitable death and pass on your beautiful\n" + "appearance to someone else. That way, your beauty, which you’ve only borrowed, wouldn’t have to\n" + "end. Then, even after you died, your beautiful body would be renewed in your children. Who would\n" + "let such a beautiful house fall into disrepair when prudent maintenance might make it outlast the\n" + "stormy gusts of winter and the frustrating barrenness surrounding death? Only the most\n" + "irresponsible spender could do such a thing, you know, my dear love. You had a father—let your son\n" + "be able to say the same."};
    public String[]  sonnet11 = {"As fast as you will decline, you could grow again just as fast, through one of your children. The youth\n" + "and vigor that you would pass on to a child now that you’re still young, you could call your own when\n" + "you’re no longer young. In marriage and childbirth lie wisdom, beauty, and reproduction. Without\n" + "them you have only foolishness, age, and the cold decay of death. If everyone thought like you, the\n" + "human race would end, and in sixty years there’d be no more world. Let the people who aren’t good\n" + "enough to preserve—the rough, ugly, poor people—die childless. Nature gave abundantly to the\n" + "people whom she endowed with beauty, and you should cherish her gifts by being generous with\n" + "them. Nature made you her stamp, to serve as a template for all human beauty. She meant for you\n" + "to make copies of yourself, so that the original—you—wouldn’t die."};
    public String[]  sonnet12 = {"When I look at the clock and notice time ticking away, and see splendid day sink into hideous night;\n" + "when I see the violet wilt and curly black hair turn white with age; when I see tall trees that once\n" + "provided shade for herds now barren of leaves, and the summer’s crops tied up and hauled to the\n" + "barn as if summer itself were an old man being carried off to his grave—then I have doubts about\n" + "the fate of your beauty, since you too will have to undergo the ravages of time. Sweet and beautiful\n" + "creatures don’t stay that way; they die as fast as they see others grow. And there’s no defense\n" + "against Time’s destructive power, except perhaps to have children—to defy Time when he takes you\n" + "away."};
    public String[]  sonnet13 = {"Oh, how I wish you were yourself! But, my love, your identity will only last as long as you’re alive.\n" + "You should make preparations in anticipation of your inevitable death and pass on your beautiful\n" + "appearance to someone else.

    public String[]  sonnet14 = {"I don’t base my judgments on the stars, and yet it does seem to me I know astrology. I can’t foresee\n" + "good or bad events—predict plagues, famines, or what a season will be like. Nor can I predict down\n" + "to the minute what each person’s misfortunes are going to be. Nor can I tell princes whether things\n" + "will go well for them by looking at the heavens. But I can forecast the future by looking in your eyes. I\n" + "see by those reliable guides that truth and beauty will thrive if you would only pass your attributes on\n" + "to a child. Otherwise, this is what I predict: When you die, truth and beauty will die with you."};
    public String[]  sonnet15 = {"When I think about the fact that every living thing is perfect only for a brief time, that the whole world\n" + "is one big stage on which the stars secretly control the action; when I see that men grow like plants,\n" + "encouraged and then thwarted by the same sky, exulting in their youthful vigor and then declining\n" + "just when they’re at their height, vanishing until their glory is no longer even remembered; when I\n" + "think about the whole world’s instability—then I think of you, a youth enjoying so many of nature’s\n" + "rich gifts. In my mind, I see time and decay debating with each other about how to corrupt your\n" + "sunny youth, how to convert it to old age and night. Out of love for you, I wage war against time: As\n" + "he takes away your youth, I continually recreate you in these poems."};
    public String[]  sonnet16 = {"But why not take advantage of a stronger way to fight against this bloody tyrant, Time, and\n" + "strengthen yourself in your old age in a happier way than with my useless sonnets? Now your\n" + "capacity for pleasure is at its peak, and many virtuous maidens would love to marry you and bear\n" + "your children, who would recreate your image much better than any artificial reproduction such as a\n" + "painting or poem. The faces of your children will renew your life. Time created you and brought you\n" + "to your present state of perfection, but it cannot preserve your inner worth or outer beauty, and\n" + "neither can my poetry. Having a baby would preserve your image and ensure that you live on by\n" + "your own design."};
    public String[]  sonnet17 = {"Who in the future will ever believe my poetry if I praise you as you deserve? Though, I have to admit,\n" + "my poetry is like a tomb that actually hides what you are really like and doesn’t manage to show\n" + "even half of your true qualities. If I could capture in my writing how beautiful your eyes are and\n" + "create new verses to list all of your wonderful attributes, decades from now people would say, “This\n" + "poet lies. No human face was ever so divine.” In this way, my poems (yellowed with age), would be\n" + "scorned, like old men who talk too much without saying anything true, and what is really your due\n" + "would be dismissed as a poet’s madness, the false verses of an old song. But if some child of yours\n" + "were still alive then, you would live twice: in the child, and in my poetry."};
    public String[]  sonnet18 = {"Shall I compare you to a summer day? You’re lovelier and milder. Rough winds shake the pretty\n" + "buds of May, and summer doesn’t last nearly long enough. Sometimes the sun shines too hot, and\n" + "often its golden face is darkened by clouds. And everything beautiful stops being beautiful, either by\n" + "accident or simply in the course of nature. But your eternal summer will never fade, nor will you lose\n" + "possession of your beauty, nor shall death brag that you are wandering in the underworld, once\n" + "you’re captured in my eternal verses. As long as men are alive and have eyes with which to see, this\n" + "poem will live and keep you alive."};
    public String[]  sonnet19 = {"Devouring Time, go ahead and blunt the lion’s paws. Make the earth swallow up her own creatures.\n" + "Pluck the sharp teeth out of the fierce tiger’s jaws, and burn the long-lived phoenix in its own blood.\n" + "Make happy and sad times as you fly by, and do whatever you want, swift-footed Time, to the wide\n" + "world and all its vanishing delights. But I forbid you to commit one heinous crime. Oh, don’t carve\n" + "wrinkles into my love’s beautiful forehead, and don’t draw lines there with your old pen. Let him pass\n" + "through time untainted, to serve as the model of beauty for men to come. But do your worst, old\n" + "Time. Despite your wrongs, my love will stay young forever in my poetry."};
    public String[]  sonnet20 = {"Your face is as pretty as a woman’s, but you don’t even have to use makeup—you, the man (or\n" + "should I say woman?) I love. Your heart is as gentle as a woman’s, but it isn’t cheating like theirs.\n" + "Your eyes are prettier than women’s, but not as roving—you bless everything you look at. You’ve got\n" + "the good looks of a handsome man, but you attract both women and men. When Mother Nature\n" + "made you, she originally intended to make you a woman, but then she got carried away with her\n" + "creation and screwed me by adding a certainthing that I have no use for. But since she gave you a\n" + "prick to please women, I’ll keep your love, and they can enjoy your body."};
    public String[]  sonnet21 = {"I’m not like that other poet iwho writes about a woman who’s pretty because she wears a lot of\n" + "makeup. In his verses, he compares her to heaven itself, and to every other beautiful thing—the sun\n" + "and moon, the rich gems of earth and sea, the first flowers of April, and all the rest of the precious\n" + "things on the face of the earth. Since I reallyam in love, I just want to write the truth, and when I do,\n" + "believe me—my lover is as beautiful as any human being, though maybe not as bright as the stars.\n" + "Whoever actually likes those love-poem clichés can say more; I’m not trying to sell anything, so I\n" + "won’t waste time with praise."};

But when I see you\n" + "with wrinkles, then I’ll know death is on its way, because your beauty is as close to my heart as\n" + "beautiful clothing to a body. Put another way, my heart beats in your chest and yours in mine. But if\n" + "that’s true, then how can I be older than you? Therefore, my love, take care of yourself just as I will\n" + "take care of myself, not for my own sake, but because I have your heart inside of me, which I will\n" + "protect as carefully as a nurse her baby. Don’t expect to get your heart back from me when mine is\n" + "dead. You gave it to me forever, never to be returned."};

So let my writings speak for my heart instead. They plead for love better\n" + "than I could if I spoke, even if I said more and more eloquently.

Those courtiers who\n" + "enjoy high status because they’re the favorites of great princes are like marigolds. They bloom as\n" + "long as the sun shines on them, but their pride is fragile—one frown will kill them. And once a\n" + "famous warrior who has painfully endured and won a thousand battles is defeated, he’s stripped of\n" + "all his honors, and all of the successes that he worked for are forgotten. How much happier am I,\n" + "who love and am loved in a place I cannot leave and from which others cannot remove me."};

I don’t have the words to express it\n" + "properly. But I hope that in your heart you’ll form an idea of what I mean and the idea will enrich your\n" + "sense of what I owe you. When the star that guides me shines on me favorably, giving me the\n" + "inspiration to dress up my tattered love for you in clever words that prove I’m worthy of your sweet\n" + "respect—that’s when I’ll dare to boast about how much I love you.

They keep my weary eyes wide open, staring at the darkness like blind people do. Except,\n" + "in my imagination, I see your image, though it’s too dark to see anything else. Like a shining jewel\n" + "hanging in the terrifying night, your image makes that old, black night look beautiful and young.

And though day\n" + "and night are natural enemies, they’ve shook hands and made a bargain to both torture me, the day\n" + "with labor, the night with thoughts of how far away you are as I labor over thoughts of you. I try to\n" + "please the day by telling him how bright you are—so bright that you take the sun’s place when\n" + "clouds cover the sky.

Oh, absence, you would be such a torment if it weren’t for the fact that you give me the\n" + "chance to fill up the lonely hours with thoughts of love, which make the time pass so sweetly, and\n" + "that you teach me how to divide my love and me in two, as I, here, praise my friend while he remains\n" + "elsewhere."};
