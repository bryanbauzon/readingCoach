AMERICAN INDIAN NAMES	"There are many understandings about American Indian names. Crazy Horse, for example, was given his name because he was courageous, not because he was insane. Indian families had no last names. The Sioux Indiana gave individuals three or four names. The first name, given at birth, showed the order of birth into the family. Wenonah, for instance, meant “firstborn daughter.” The second name, the honor name, which was given to the child by a medicine man, usually referred to the line character or great deeds of one of the child’s ancestors. When grown, the person was expected to live up to this name; otherwise, the person might not be called by it. The third name, the nickname, usually referred to something odd that the person had done. It was hardly ever flattering. The fourth name, the deed name, was given by a war chief after the person accomplished some feat of extraordinary bravery. The name might be that of a fear-inspiring animal such as Bear or Buffalo or that of a noble bird, such as Eagle, Hawk, or Owl.
