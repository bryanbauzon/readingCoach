HOW TO BE A PIG	"To be a pig, you'd first need a round, thought snout like a built-in shovel, it would help you root or grub for food. You d have poor eyesight, but your senses of smell and hearing would be excellent. In spite of your barrel-shaped body and little legs, you'd be a swift, sure-footed runner and a good swimmer. 
People sometimes call pigs names like greedy or dirty. But pigs aren't greedy, they're simply not fussy eaters. Although they eat almost anything-leaves, roots, berries, insects, eggs, small mammals, and snakes-wild pigs rarely overeat. 

And they aren't dirty. It's true that they are fond of mud baths. But hippos and elephants like mud baths too. Mud soothes insect bites and protects and cools pig's hides. Even tame pigs wallow in the mud.
