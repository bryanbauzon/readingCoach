USE OF TOUNGE IN ANIMAL WORLD	"In the animal world, tongues have a variety of uses. The okapi, a relative of the giraffe, uses its tongue to strip leaves off trees. Hummingbirds have tongues like straws for sucking nectar from flowers. The anteater’s long tongue helps it catch ants and other insects. The rattlesnakes tongue flicks in and out of its mouth picking up smells from the air and ground. And when eagles pant with their tongues, like dogs, it helps them to cool off. 
One of the most interesting tongues belongs to a lizard called the gecko. It serves as a wiper for the lizards transparent eyelids. 
We humans don’t use our tongues this way, but we do something with ours that animals can’t do.  We form sounds into words so that we can speak.
