MUMMY	A mummy is simply a dead body that has been preserved by drying. The Egyptians believed people couldn't survive in the spirit world unless their bodies were well preserved. To turn a body into a mummy, people first removed all the organs except the heart. The heart was thought to be the seat of intelligence and feelings. So it was left in the body. The other organs were put in containers. Then the body was covered with a kind of salt called natron. The natron soaked up moisture from the body. When the body was completely dry, people wrapped long strips of cloth around it. They poured perfumed oils on the wrappings. Then the mummy was put in a coffin. It took about seventy days to prepare a mummy. But Egyptians believed the spirit of the person would then live forever. 	L. Frank Baum
