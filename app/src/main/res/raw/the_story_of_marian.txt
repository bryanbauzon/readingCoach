	"Marian Anderson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1902. She became one ofthe greatest singers the world has ever known.
She began singing in church choirs when she was eight years old. She had an outstanding voice, but because her family was poor, it was difficult for her to get a musical education. Groups that had heard her raised money so that she could study music. And in 1930 she won a scholarship and was able to study in Europe. Her European debut in Berlin, Germany, was a huge success and her fame spread. She delighted audiences in every major city of Europe. She returned to the United States in 1935 to continue her career. One of her highest acclaims came in 1939, when she gave a concert for 75,000 people from the steps ofthe Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. In 1955 she became the first Negro to sing as a regular member of the Metropolitan Opera Company of New York City. Three years later, in 1958, Marian Anderson served as the United States delegate to the United Nations.
