I used to be so careful when I’d travel to secure all my trivial possessions with the most reliable locks
available so criminals wouldn’t tamper with them. But you, so much more precious than my jewels
and my greatest comfort, have become my greatest sadness and worry, because you’re vulnerable
to any common thief. I haven’t locked you up in any chest, other than in my own chest, where my
heart is, and you’re not really there, even though I feel that you are. You can come and go from my
heart as you please, and I’m afraid you’ll be stolen from there, because even an honest man would
turn thief to get such a rich prize.
