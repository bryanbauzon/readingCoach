"Are there snowballs in space? Many astronomers think that comets--those heavenly bodies with long, bright tails-may be ""dirty snowballs"" trailing specks of ice and dust. For some time astronomers have figured that the small head of a comet is made up of frozen gases, ice, and dust particles. Now astronomers say that comets may not be the only ""dirty snowballs"" in space. Two research teams of astronomers studied the light reflected, or bounced back, from the moons of the planet Saturn. The two teams used different equipment. But they got similar results. Both teams found evidence that at least three of Saturn�s ten moons may be �dirty snowballs.� The moons--named Rhea, Dione, and Tethys--seem to be made up mostly of water, ice, and dust particles. Could other even larger moons also be �dirty snowballs�? Maybe. Meanwhile, if the astronomers are right, then Rhea, Dione and Tethys just might be the largest ""ice cubes"" in our solar system.
