If I were made of thought instead of slow, dull flesh, this wicked distance between us wouldn’t
keep me from where I wanted to be. No matter the distance—from the farthest possible
regions—I would bring myself to where you are. It wouldn’t matter that my feet were standing
on the spot on earth farthest from you: Thought is nimble enough to jump over both sea and
land as quickly as it can think about the place it wants to be. But, ah, it’s killing me to think that
I’m not made of thought and can’t leap over the many miles when you are gone. Instead my
body is made of so much earth and water that I have to fill the long time without you with my
moans. The leaden, deep earth and slow, wet water of which I am made give me nothing but
heavy tears.
