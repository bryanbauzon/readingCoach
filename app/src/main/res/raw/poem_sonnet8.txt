You’re like music to listen to, so why does listening to music make you sad? Delightful and joyful
things should complement one another. So why do you love things that make you unhappy and
enjoy things that are bad for you? If music played well and in tune sounds bad to you, it’s because
that music is rebuking you for not playing your own part—not making your own harmony—by getting
married and having children. Notice how the sound of two strings vibrating together in harmony is
like a father and child and happy mother, who all sing one pleasing note together. Though their
music has no words, the unity of their voices sings this warning to you: If you stay single, you’ll be a
childless nobody.
