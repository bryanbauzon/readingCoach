When forty years have gone by and carved deep wrinkles in your forehead, your youthful beauty,
which everyone likes to look at now, will be worth little. Then, when someone asks you where all
your beauty is—all the treasure of your virile youth—if you were to say that it’s all there in your
withered face and sunken eyes, that would be an all-consuming shame and nothing to be proud of.
You’d have a much better excuse if, decades from now, you could say you spent your beauty and
youth raising a child. If someone were to ask you why you looked so old, you could say, “The effort I
spent raising this beautiful child explains the sorry old state I’m in”—and meanwhile your child’s
beauty would be a new incarnation of your own! Having a beautiful child would be like being born
again in old age, with the blood that flows coldly in your old veins becoming warm again in his.
