"Gustavo works far away from his home. He drives a car to work. It takes him 3 hours to get there.
Gustavo drives. While he drives, he thinks about many things. He thinks about his little girl. She likes to
ride horses. He thinks about his little boy. He plays fireman all the time. He thinks about his wife. She
milks the cows on the farm. Gustavo thinks of things he needs to do when he gets home. He needs to
cut the grass. It is too long. He needs to water the flowers so they will grow. He wants to read a story to
his little girl. He wants to play a game with his little boy. He wants to sit with his wife. He wants to tell
her about his day."
