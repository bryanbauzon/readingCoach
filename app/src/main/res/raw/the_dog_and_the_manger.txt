THE DOG AND THE MANGER	A dog was asleep in a manger full of hay. He woke up when the cattle came in to eat. They had been working in the fields and were tired and hungry. But the dog would not let them get near the manger. He snapped and barked and growled at them. The cattle looked at the dog with disgust. “How selfish he is! He cannot eat the hay and he will not let us eat it and we are so hungry,” the cattle all said. The farmer heard all this and came in. When he saw what the dog was doing, he beat the dog with a stick and drove him out of the stable.	Thomas Huxman
