Today is a special day for Talia. She is getting ready for a dinner celebration. She wants to look very nice for her night out. First, she gets her hair cut at a salon. A salon is a place where people go to get their hair and nails done. Then, she gets her fingernails painted pink. A woman who works at the salon paints Talia"s nails. Talia is not happy with the color. She asks the woman to change the color to purple. She likes the purple very much. It is almost time to go out. Talia goes home and looks in her closet. She tries on a pair of light blue pants with a white shirt. She tries on a purple dress with a black belt. She tries on a brown skirt with a green top. She wears the purple dress. Many of her friends and family are at the restaurant when she gets there. She hugs her mother and father. She gives her grandfather a kiss. Talia"s sister gives her a big smile. Her best friend, Asra, gives her a present. Tomorrow is Talia"s birthday, but she is celebrating it tonight. "Happy Birthday, Talia," they say. "You look great!" "I feel great because all of you are here," says Talia, "for my last night as a teenager."
