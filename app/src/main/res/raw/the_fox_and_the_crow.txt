THE FOX AND THE CROW	A crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in its beak when a fox came up and saw him. He really wanted that cheese for himself. He stood under the tree and said, “What a beautiful bird! If only his voice was as beautiful as his feathers, he would be the best bird there could be!” The crow was flattered with this and opened his beak to show the fox how beautifully he could sing. Of course, the cheese fell to the ground. The fox grabbed it and said, laughing, “You have a voice, I can see. What you do not have is wits!”	Gotthold Ephraim Lessing
