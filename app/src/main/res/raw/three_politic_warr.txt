"Gains Julius Caesar was born around 100 B.C in Rome. He became one of the greatest men of all time. Most great men excel in only one thing, but Julius Caesar excelled in three-politics war and literature. Caesar is probably best remembered as one of historyï¿½s ablest generals. He led his armies into Gaul, Britain, Egypt, and Germany. During his nine years in Gaul, he lost only two battles. Later he defeated the Egyptians and made Cleopatra their queen. His clear account of his conquest of Gaul is a classic of literature; it is used as a model for military and historical writing. His speaking ability was one factor for his rise in politics. So too was his loyalty to the common people; throughout his life he stood for reforms that helped the poor. At the age of forty-one he held the highest office the common people could give him. Later he was made dictator for life. Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 B.C. But his greatness was not forgotten, the name Caesar became a title for the ruler of an empire.
