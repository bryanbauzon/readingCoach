During summer months plants work hard. Their roots take in water.  Their leaves make food and their flowers make seeds. 

As the seeds grow, the flower petals drop off. Soon nothing is left of each flower but the little swelling where the seeds are growing. 

As the days pass, the swellings begirrto change and become berries, or nuts. or other kinds of fruits. inside the fruits are the seeds. 

These seeds must now go travelling. Some will float through the air. Others will catch hold of an animal's fur. Some will be dropped by animals that ate the fruits, and in each seed a plant waits to begin its life.
