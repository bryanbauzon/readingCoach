COUNTING	"Archaeologists believe that counting large quantities began about 10,000 years ago. Early farmers had to
account for communally stored crops. Early counting systems involved small tokens which represented
farmers’ stores. In the area which is now southern Iraq, little figures shaped like discs, balls, and
pyramids were used in about 7500 B.C. to represent various holdings. Later, marks which represented
the figures were inscribed on clay tablets by use of a blunt reed to cut into the wet clay. Still, the
symbols were always connected with specific merchandise. Around 3000 B.C., people began using clay
tablets and a new accounting system which they perfected over the next 4,000 years. A writing system
called cuneiform, which consisted of wedge–shaped symbols, was also invented. At the same time,
other cultures were independently developing numbering and writing systems. Soon philosophers
began to discover than nature was subject to laws which could be expressed with numbers."	Susan Carter
