The fact that you now have my mistress isn’t the only reason I’m hurt, though it’s true that I loved her
dearly. What makes me cry the most is that now she has you, a loss of love that hurts me even
more. You two criminals in love, here’s how I’ll rationalize the pain you’ve caused me: You, friend,
love her because you know I love her. And she loves you for the exact same reason, putting up with
your praises and lovemaking for my sake, because she knows you’re my friend. If I lose you, it’s a
win for my mistress. And if I lose her, you will have found what I’ve lost. Both of the people I love find
each other, and I lose them both, and both cause me this pain. But here’s what makes me happy:
My friend and I are one person. How gratifying!—It turns out my mistress loves only me.
