DOGS	"There are wild dogs and pet dogs. Pet dogs are helpers and friends to people. There were no pet dogs
15,000 years ago. Men and women learned how to work with dogs. Dogs helped humans travel from
Asia to North America 10,000 years ago by pulling sleds in the snow. People say dogs are “man’s best
friend.” They help with farming. They help with hunting. They help with fishing. They can pull things for
people. They can help find things. There are many colors of dogs. There are white dogs, gray dogs, black
dogs, and brown dogs. A dog’s fur can be short or long. Dogs have curly hair or straight fur. There are
very small dogs. They are only 6-8 inches tall. There are very big dogs. They are about 3 feet tall. Some
dogs can see well. Some dogs do not see very well. All dogs can hear well. They can hear sounds that
people cannot hear. They can hear high sounds and low sounds. They can hear sound very far away. All
dogs can smell very well. They can smell 40 times better than humans! Dogs live 5 to 13 years, but some
dogs live much longer. One dog lived to be 24 years old!"	Susan Carter
