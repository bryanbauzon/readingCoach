Just as a decrepit father takes pleasure in seeing his active child engaging in youthful activities, so I,
whom misfortune has injured and crippled, take all the comfort I can in your good worth and fidelity.
For whether beauty, nobility, wealth, and intelligence—or any one of these, or all of them, or more
than these—are your princely attributes, I’m attaching my love to them. I’m not lame, poor, or
despised, as long as this fantasy of mine lets me take so much satisfaction in your good luck and I
can live off part of your glory. Whatever is best, that’s what I wish you to have. Since I have this
wish, I’m lucky ten times over.
