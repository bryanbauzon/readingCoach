	The word balloon has had an interesting history. In 1600 the English played a game of football much like the modern game of rugby. The players either kicked a ball or hit it with their arms and hands. The bell was no large that the players wore wooden arm braces to keep from being hurt. Both the game and the bell were called balloon, which came horn the Punch word hellon. meaning a large hell. But I for larger bell was invented by the Montgolfier brothers of France in 1783. This was a huge beg Elled with hot air, which rose high above the earth. This. too, was called a balloon and led to the sort of balloons we have today. 	Jack London
