Are you eating up your own life by remaining single because you’re afraid your widow will cry when
you die? Ah, if you happen to die childless, the entire world will mourn for you like a wife who’s lost
her husband. The world will be your widow and weep forever about the fact that you didn’t leave a
copy of yourself. But if you had left a wife behind, she’d have had her children to look at and remind
her of her husband. A person who wastes his money is just shifting money around—at least the
money’s still in the world. But if beauty is wasted, the world loses it forever: If a beautiful person
doesn’t use his beauty, he destroys it. The person who would commit such a murderous outrage on
himself has no love in his heart for others.
