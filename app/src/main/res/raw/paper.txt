PAPER	"Paper has many uses. People draw on paper. People paint on paper. People write on paper. People
clean with paper. People make boxes out of paper. People blow their noses on paper. Books are made
of paper. Magazines are made of paper. Some money is printed on paper. Sandpaper is made of paper.
Wallpaper is made of paper. Some paper is made from plants. Some paper is made from cotton. Some
paper is made from bamboo. Some paper is made from wheat. Most paper is made from trees. 95% of
paper is made from trees. Some paper is made from pine trees. Some paper is made from oak trees.
Some paper is made from maple trees. Some paper is recycled. When paper is recycled, new paper is
made from old paper. Some people say they work in paper-free offices. Some people think computers
will take away the need for paper. But people will always need to blow their noses. People will want to
sand surfaces with sandpaper. People will want to paint or draw on paper. People will want to put things
in paper boxes. So, people will probably need to use paper for many more years."	Susan Carter
