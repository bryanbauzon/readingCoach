The Chicago Bears are a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) North Division. They were founded in 1919. They initially played in Decatur, Illinois, and moved to Chicago in 1921. They are one of the only two remaining franchises that were founding members of the NFL (the other is the Cardinals franchise). The history of the Chicago Bears is long. They were originally known as the Staleys because the owner was the A. E. Staley Food Company. They were renamed the Bears when George Halas bought them in 1921. Halas purchased rights to the team for $100. Halas would control the team until 1983 and served as head coach on and off for over 40 years. The Chicago Bears dominated the league in its early years. In the league�s first six years, the Bears posted 34 shutouts and won the 1921 Championship Title. They would also win championships in 1932, 1933, 1934, 1940, 1941, 1943, and 1946. During this time, the Bears also formed rivalries with the Chicago Cardinals and the Green Bay Packers. In 1940, the Bears made history by crushing the Washington Redskins 73�0 in the Championship Game. The 73�0 score remains the most lopsided score in NFL history. Their victory in the 1963 NFL Championship Game over the New York Giants (14�10) would be their eighth championship (but last until 1986). In 1986, the Bears, led by quarterback Jim McMahon, legendary running back Walter Payton, and head coach Mike Ditka, won their first Super Bowl, 46�10, over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX. Many people believe the 1985 Bears (who won the Super Bowl in 1986) had the most fearsome defense in football history. During the 1985 season, the Bears achieved a record of 15 wins and one loss. In 1995, the Bears made it to Super Bowl XLI but were defeated by Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts, 29�17. On November 18, 2010, the Bears secured the record for the most wins by any NFL franchise with their 700th.
