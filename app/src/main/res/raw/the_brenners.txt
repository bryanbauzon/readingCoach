"The Brenner family has a mom, a dad, three boys, two dogs, a hamster, and four frogs. They are
very happy. Their house is very small. Mom and Dad share one bedroom. The three boys share
one bedroom. Their names are Billy, Bobby, and Brad. All the pets sleep in the living room. Mr.
and Mrs. Brenner came home today from the doctor with news. It is very big news. �There are
going to be two more of us,� Mrs. Brenner says with a smile. �I am pregnant.� Billy, Bobby, and
Brad cheer. �We will have a basketball team,� Billy says. �And do you know what Dad and I have
decided we need?� asks Mrs. Brenner. �A coach?� asks Bobby. �No,� Mr. Brenner says with a
laugh. �A bigger house.� Over the next week, the Brenner family starts looking for a new house.
On Monday, they see a brick house with a big front porch. It has three bedrooms. Mr. Brenner
likes this one. On Thursday, they see a wooden house with a big backyard. It has four
bedrooms. Mrs. Brenner thinks this house is great. On Saturday, they see a house with four
bedrooms and a pool. The boys like this house a lot. They dream of having their friends over for
a swim. �But it�s smaller than the house we live in now!� Mrs. Brenner says. All of the houses
cost a lot of money. �I think we need to save more money before we buy a bigger house,� says
Mr. Brenner. Mrs. Brenner agrees. Soon, two new babies arrive in their very small house. Their
names are Brandi and Brooke. The two baby girls sleep in a crib by their parents� bed. Mr.
Brenner buys a basketball hoop and puts it in the driveway."
