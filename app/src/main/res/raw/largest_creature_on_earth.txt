Whales are the largest creatures that have ever existed on earth. They are warm-blooded mammals, not fish, so they need to breathe air to live. Most whales are gentle, even playful, both among themselves and around people. Whales move in herds, often migrating year after year between the same areas. They communicate with each other by making a series of high-pitched noises that sound like singing. Whales normally cruise at about six knots-~approximately twice as fast as a person usually walks. They are capable, in short bursts, of speeds up to twenty knots and they have been known to pace large ocean liners. The blue whale is the largest of all whales. Its heart can weigh more than fifty-four kilograms (1200 pounds). Some of its arteries are so large a small child could crawl through them.
