]One of the worlds wildest saltwater races is in Canada, across British Columbia's Strait of Georgia in--of all things-bathtubs, Though about three hundred tubs start the fifty-six kilometer (thirty-six-mile) race, usually fewer than seventy finish. The rest are victims of seasickness, swamping, amateur naval architecture, or faulty plumbing. But the losers aren't unhappy, since there are many trophies-including one for the first tub to sink. Tubs can be built of cast iron or fiberglass, but can use nothing larger than a six-horsepower engine. Every tub skipper must know how to swim, must have an escort vessel, and must take along a lifejacket, a bucket (for bailing), and a paddle. Skippers .get maps of the race course, a free supply of anti-seasickness pills, and souvenir tub plugs on chains, On the day of the Great Bathtub Race, thousands gather on boats to watch. At the signal to start, the water turns White from racing engines. Dozens sink almost at once. One year, though, a skipper not only won second prize but ran the tub all the way back to the start.
