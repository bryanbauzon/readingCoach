As fast as you will decline, you could grow again just as fast, through one of your children. The youth
and vigor that you would pass on to a child now that you’re still young, you could call your own when
you’re no longer young. In marriage and childbirth lie wisdom, beauty, and reproduction. Without
them you have only foolishness, age, and the cold decay of death. If everyone thought like you, the
human race would end, and in sixty years there’d be no more world. Let the people who aren’t good
enough to preserve—the rough, ugly, poor people—die childless. Nature gave abundantly to the
people whom she endowed with beauty, and you should cherish her gifts by being generous with
them. Nature made you her stamp, to serve as a template for all human beauty. She meant for you
to make copies of yourself, so that the original—you—wouldn’t die.
