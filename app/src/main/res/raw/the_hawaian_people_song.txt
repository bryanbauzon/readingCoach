THE HAWAIIAN PEOPLE SONG	"Hawaii was once ruled by a king or queen. Lydia Kamekeha wee a queen of Hawaii. 
When Lydia was young, she lived as most of the natives in Hawaii did. She went barefoot, wore few clothes, and spoke Hawaiian. Later she went to school. She learned English and wore dresses and shoes. But she missed the ways other people. So she wrote songs about them. She wrote The Hawaiian People Song, which became the national anthem. Later she wrote the song Aloha Oe. People still hear this when they come to or leave Hawaii. Years later Lydia became Queen Liliuokalani. She worked to bring back the old native ways. Some of the songs and dances she brought back are still popular.
