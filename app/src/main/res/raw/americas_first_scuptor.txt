"Patience Wright was America�s first sculptor. She was born in New Jersey in 1725. As a child she made likenesses with bread dough of her family and friends. She was married to a local farmer and experimented with wax figures. Perhaps she was inspired by the popular travelling exhibits of wax images. At forty-four she was widowed. She decided to move to New York to start a waxworks museum.
It was very successful; people delighted in her wax figures of criminals and great people of history. She then moved to London. She was successful there, too. She even made wax portraits of the king and queen. The American Revolution made her less popular, however. She was supposed to have been a spy for Benjamin Franklin during the Revolution, sending him information in the wax heads of dolls. Again popular after the war, she died in 1786. She wanted to be returned to her �dear America,� but she was buried in England.
