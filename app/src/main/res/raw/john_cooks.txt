JOHN COOKS	John’s wife knows John loves to read cookbooks. She decides to get him one for his birthday. John tells her he will try to make a new recipe for three days in a row. On Monday, John makes blueberry pancakes for breakfast. He gets the blueberries from the farmers’ market. On Tuesday, John makes beef soup for dinner. He puts in cubes of beef, carrots, and onions. The recipe calls for cream, but John does not like cream. He uses water instead. On Wednesday, John makes a tomato salad with cucumbers and onions. He picks the cucumbers and tomatoes from his garden. He likes this dish best. It was also the easiest for him to make.	Patricia Willis
