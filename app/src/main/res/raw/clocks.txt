"Clocks are used to measure time. Clocks are used to show the time. Clocks are used so that people can
agree on the time. People use clocks to measure units of time that are shorter than natural units.
Natural units are the day, the month, and the year. The sun rises at the beginning of each day. The moon
is new at the beginning of each month. The sun appears at the same place in the sky at the beginning of
each year. The clock is a very old invention. Sundials were used in ancient times. Sundials work by
measuring shadows that are cast by the sun. Candle clocks were used a very long time ago. Candle
clocks work by measuring the time it takes for the wax to melt. Hourglasses are similar to candle clocks
because they also measure the time it takes for something to happen. Hourglasses work by measuring
the time it takes for sand to pour through a small opening into a glass. Mechanical clocks appeared in
the 13th century in Europe. They work with a system of moving gears. The gears always move at the
same speed. Pendulum clocks work with a swinging weight. The swinging weight is called a pendulum.
The pendulum makes the clock parts move. Now people typically use mechanical clocks or digital clocks.
Digital clocks show numbers on a screen. The numbers represent the time. Some people use auditory
clocks. Auditory clocks use language to tell the time aloud. Computers also use clocks. Computers use
internal clocks in order to work properly. In today's world, clocks are everywhere '' in homes, schools,
offices, and public places. Many people live their lives according to the clock. People go to work and
return home according to the clock. School days start and end according to the clock. Airplanes take off
and land according to the clock. It is fun to imagine a world without clocks!"
