"�Something is very wrong,� says the detective. �I know!� says Ms. Gervis. �It is wrong that someone has
stolen from me!� The detective looks around Ms. Gervis� apartment. �That is not what I am talking
about, ma�am. What is wrong is that I do not understand how the robber got in and out.� Ms. Gervis and
the detective stand in silence. Ms. Gervis� eyes are full of tears. Her hands are shaking. �The robber did
not come through the window,� says the detective. �These windows have not been opened or shut in
months.� The detective looks at the fireplace. �The robber did not squeeze down here.� The detective
walks to the front door. He examines the latch. �And since there are no marks or scratches, the robber
definitely did not try to break the lock.� �I have no idea how he did it,� says a bothered Ms. Gervis. �It is
a big mystery.� �And you say the robber stole nothing else?� asks the detective. �No money, no jewelry,
no crystal?� �That�s right, detective. He took only what was important to me,� Ms. Gervis says with a
sigh. �There is only one thing I can do now.� �And what is that?� the detective asks with surprise. �I will
stop baking cakes,� Ms. Gervis says. �They are mine to give away. They are not for someone to steal.�
�You can�t do that!� says the detective with alarm. �Who will bake those delicious cakes?� �I am sorry. I
do not know,� says Ms. Gervis. �I must solve this case immediately!� says the detective."	Susan Carter
