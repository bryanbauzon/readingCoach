THE ROOSTER AND THE JEWEL	One day a young, hungry rooster was scratching in the dirt for food. He turned up a jewel. He knew it was something different and precious but did not know what to do with it. “You are a very fine thing but you are not to my taste at all. I would rather have one grain of fine barley than all the jewels of the world.”	Michellin Core
