TIME TO	It is 6:15 a.m. It is time to wake up. It is time to take a shower. It is time to brush teeth. It is time to get dressed. It is time to eat breakfast. It is time to go to work. It is time to eat lunch. It is time to go back to work. It is time to go home. It is time to eat dinner. It is time to go to sleep. “Billy,” she says. “What?” Billy says. "It is time to wake up!"
