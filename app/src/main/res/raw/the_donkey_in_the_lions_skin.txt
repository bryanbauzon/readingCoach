THE DONKEY IN THE LION'S SKIN	"One day a donkey found a lion’s skin left by a hunter. He dressed himself in it and amused himself by rushing out of the trees to scare the animals who passed by. He laughed as they all ran away from him—fast! After a few times, he got so excited and pleased to see them all run that he opened his mouth and let out a loud sound—a donkey’s braying. A fox, who had run with the rest, stopped as soon as he heard the sound. He went up to the donkey. “If you had kept your mouth shut you might have frightened me, too. But you gave yourself away with that silly bray!”
