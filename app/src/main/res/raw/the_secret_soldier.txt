THE SECRET SOLDIER	"The year was 1782. Deborah Sampson was twenty-two years old. She wanted to travel. She wanted
adventure. If a man wanted adventure in those. days, he joined the army. Why couldn’t she? She
laughed at herself. How silly! Only men could be soldiers in those days. Then she thought some more.
Why not? she asked herself. I&#39;ll dress as a man! I’ll join the army!
Those were the days of the American Revolution. The colonies were fighting to be free from British rule.
They needed men to fight.
Deborah dressed as a man. She called herself “Robert Shurtliff.” She joined the army. At first she was
afraid. Would people tell that she was a woman? She thought someone would surely notice. But no one
did.
It was a hard life. Deborah had to make a long march. The march took almost two weeks. She grew tired.
Each day it was worse. She felt she could not go on. But she kept going.
The other soldiers called her “Bobby.” They liked her. They thought she was just very young--a boy of
fifteen. That explained why she had no beard. That explained why she wasn’t used to the hard life.
One day she fainted and fell. When she woke, she was sure that her secret was out. Then someone
spoke”Too bad such a young boy has to go to war.” No one had guessed.
Deborah soon learned that war was no adventure. It was a terrible thing. Soldiers were badly hurt. They
went without food. They died. But Deborah went bravely on.
One day Deborah was wounded twice. A bullet struck her in the neck. Another entered her leg. A soldier
stopped to help her.
“Leave me,” she said. “Save yourself. I will die anyway.” But the soldier carried her to a hospital.
A doctor treated her neck wound.
But she did not mention her leg wound. She might have to undress for the doctor People would learn
that she was a woman.
Deborah had a knife. She used it to cut the bullet out of her own leg! It hurt terribly, but she managed to
do it. Then she went back to war.
Later, Deborah caught a bad fever. She was very ill: This time a doctor learned her secret. He told the
general. “ The general was not angry. He said, “You have my respect.” But she could not stay in the
army. She had to leave. She had served for a year and a half. She had been a brave soldier.
Later Deborah married. She\h\ad children. But she still wanted adventure. So she travelled from town
to town giving talks. She told people about her soldiering days.
She is still remembered for her courage."	Craig Benjamin
