My eye and my heart have gone to war with each other. They’re fighting over who gets to control
your image. My eye wants to bar my heart from the image that it formed, while my heart wants to
keep my eye away fromits image. My heart insists that your image lies safely hidden inside of him,
protected from eyes, which give everything away. But my eye, the defendant, denies the charges
and argues that your beauty resides in him. To decide whose claim is right, I have assembled a jury
consisting of my thoughts, all of which owe allegiance to the heart. And they have delivered a verdict
to determine which portion of your image belongs to the eyes and which precious portion to the
heart. This is what they say: My eyes have the rights to your outward appearance, and my heart has
the right to love you and be loved by you.
