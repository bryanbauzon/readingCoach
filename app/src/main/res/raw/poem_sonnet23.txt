Like an actor who hasn’t learned his lines perfectly and forgets his part because of stage fright, or
like some raging animal or human whose excessive passion makes it weak, so I, because I can’t
trust myself, forget to say the things a lover should say to his darling; just when my love is strongest
it seems to be getting weak. So let my writings speak for my heart instead. They plead for love better
than I could if I spoke, even if I said more and more eloquently. Oh, read in these silent lines the love
I cannot express in speech. Love will give you the insight to read between the lines.
