Red-carpet treatment was given to a family of mallard ducks in Memphis, Tennessee, in the United States. For forty years, the family-known as the Mallarde-lived on the top floor of one of the citys hotels. At seven oclock each morning they entered the lobby. They headed straight for a fountain where they played for hours. People of all ages came to watch the ducks. Children brought hits of food for the feathered group. Then, at three oclock, horns blew a fanfare. At that time the Mallarde got out of the water. The ducks walked down a long red carpet. They: got on the hotel elevator. It took them back to their home on the top floor.
