We want the most beautiful people to have children, so their beauty will be preserved forever—when
the parent dies, the child he leaves behind will remind us of his beauty. But you, in love with your
own pretty eyes, are letting your beauty burn itself out. You’re starving the world of your beauty
rather than spreading the wealth around. You’re acting like your own worst enemy! Right now you’re
the best-looking thing in the world, the only person as beautiful as springtime. But your beauty is like
a new bud, and you’re letting it die before it can develop and bring you true happiness. You’re a
young man, but you act like an old miser—you’re wasting your beauty by hoarding it and keeping it
to yourself! Take pity on the rest of us, or this is how you’ll be remembered: as the greedy pig who
hogged his own beauty and took it with him to the grave.
