MOORISH DANCE	"One of the May Day amusements in England during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was the morris dance. Originally known as the “Moorish dance”, it often included characters dressed in costume as the Moore of Spain, as well as Robin Hood, Maid Marian, and Friar Tuck One of the Moorish characters often rode a make-believe Arabian horse. It was made of cane and covered with hide or cloth. The horse was fastened around the waist of the dancer, who would then prance and show off the lively nature of the imaginary steed The horse came to be known as hobbyhorse, since hobby was the name for a small horse. In time, someone had the idea of turning the hobbyhorse into a plaything for young children. Hobbies, as these toys were called, became so popular that children would play devotedly with them instead of other toys. People began to compare children’s play with hobbies to the love that adults have for their own pastimes. Thus, the word hobby came to mean any activity that people do solely for fun.
