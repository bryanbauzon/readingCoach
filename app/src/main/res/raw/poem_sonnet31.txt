You have the love of everyone who used to love me, people who I supposed were dead because I
didn’t have their love anymore. Love reigns in your heart—both everything belonging to love and all
those friends who I thought were dead and buried. How many tears of devoted love have I shed at
funerals, in payment to the dead, when now it appears they had only gone to hide in your heart.
You’re like a grave where dead lovers come alive again, decorated with mementos of those lost
loves who gave you all the love I owed to each of them. All the love I owed to many is now yours
alone. I see these lovers in you, and you, who contain everyone I have ever loved or was loved by,
have all of me.
