THE DOG AND HIS REFLECTION	"A dog carrying a nice piece of meat that he had stolen, was crossing a log over a river on his way home. He saw his reflection in the water and saw another dog with a wonderful piece of meat in its mouth. The dog thought it was another dog and he wanted that piece of meat also. So he snapped at it greedily. However, when he did this, he dropped the piece he had and the reflection disappeared as well.
