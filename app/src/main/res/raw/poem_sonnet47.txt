My eye and my heart have reached an agreement, and now each does the other favors. When my
eye is starving to take a look at you or my heart smothers itself with sighs of love for you, then my
eye feasts on a painting of you and invites my heart to join in the banquet and stare at the painting
too. On another occasion, my eye is the guest with whom my heart shares some of his thoughts of
love. So when you are gone, you’re still present with me, either through your painting or in my love
for you: You can’t travel farther than my thoughts, and I’m always with them, and they are always
with you. Even if my thoughts go to sleep, your painting will wake up my heart and delight both heart
and eyes.
