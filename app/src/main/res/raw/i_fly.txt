I FLY	"I fly airplanes for a living. I am a pilot. Sometimes I take my little girl with me. Her name is Bristol. Bristol
likes to look out the window of the airplane. She likes to look at the clouds. She thinks the clouds look
like animals. She points at one with her finger. &quot;I see a giraffe!&quot; she says. I also have a little boy. My little
boy does not like to be up high. He does not come with me on the airplane. He likes to play airplane with
me. We play airplane when I get home. We run around the yard. We wave our arms in the air. We make
airplane noises."	Susan Carter
