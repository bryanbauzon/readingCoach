"One of South America"s mysteries is Easter Island. Easter Island, also called Rapa Nui and Isla de Pascua,
3,600 km (2,237 mi) west of Chile, is a volcanic island with an interesting and partly unknown history.
The island was named by the Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen because he encountered it on Easter
Sunday 1722. He was the first European to find the island. The official name of the island, Isla de Pascua,
means Easter Island in Spanish. This island is famous because of the approximately 887 huge statues
which were found there. The statues consist of heads and complete torsos, the largest of which weighs
84 tons! These monuments, called moai, were carved out of compressed volcanic ash, called tuff, which
was found at a quarry at a place called Rano Raraku. Statues are still being found. Some of the
monuments were left only half"carved. Nobody knows why Rano Raraku was abandoned. It is thought
that the statues were carved by the ancestors of the modern Polynesian inhabitants. But the purpose of
the statues and the reason they were abandoned remain mysteries."
