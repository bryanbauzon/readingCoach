The Dallas Cowboys have been an NFL team since 1960. They are one of two teams that play professional football in the state of Texas. It took the Cowboys eleven years before they made the Super Bowl, the NFL championship game. They lost that game to the Baltimore Colts by a score of 16 to 13. The Cowboys soon got much better! In the 1970s, they played in five Super Bowls and won two of them. After they defeated the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 12, people started calling them America�s Team! Although the Cowboys failed to make any Super Bowls in the 1980s, they played in three Super Bowls in the 1990s and won all three of them, including two in a row against the Buffalo Bills and one against their big rival, the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was during this time that quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith, and wide receiver Michael Irvin all became big stars. All three would eventually become members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Cowboys won their last Super Bowl in 1995 and haven�t made it back since. That hasn�t discouraged owner Jerry Jones from spending big bucks, though. In 2009, Cowboys Stadium opened. It can hold over 110,000 people, making it the largest domed stadium in the world. It cost over one billion dollars to build!
