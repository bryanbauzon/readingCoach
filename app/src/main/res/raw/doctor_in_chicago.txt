DOCTOR IN CHICAGO	"
Daniel Kale Williams became a doctor in Chicago in 1888. After graduating, he taught at Northwestern University's medical school. He was asked by the president of the United States, Grover Cleveland to go to Washington D.C. to head the Freedmen‘s Hospital. It was one of the few hospitals for blacks in the country. He went back to Chicago to help establish Provident Hospital. Before it opened, Chicago’s black doctors could not practice in hospitals. They had to treat patients at home. 80 operations were performed on couches and kitchen tables. Dr. Williams also helped set up a training school in Chicago for black nurses. In 1898 he operated on a man who was dying from a stab wound in the heart. Such a wound had always meant death. But Dr. Williams tried to save the man. Without X rays or blood transfusions, he opened the men's chest and sewed up his heart. The bold operation succeeded. The man lived.
