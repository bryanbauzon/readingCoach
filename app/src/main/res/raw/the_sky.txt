THE SKY	"
What we call the sky is nothing but air with billions of tiny bits of dust floating in it. It gets its blue hue ham the sun. The light than the sun is a mixture of purple, blue, green. yellow. orange, and red rays. but we never see the rays separately except in a rainbow. As the purple, blue, and green rays of light stream down from the sun, they are scattered by the bitsof dust in the air. The red, orange, and yellow rays are not scattered as much. When we look up at the slay in the daytime, we see the blue light rays reflected, or bounced back to us, by the bits of dust. We see blue sky.
