"There are houses all over the world. Some houses are large. Some are small. Some are made of wood.
Some are made of rock. Some are made of mud. Some are made of cloth. In cold places, some houses
are made of ice " frozen water! People usually build their houses with something that is easy to find. For
example, there are many trees in a forest. So people who live there might build a house made of logs.
Some houses have one room. Some houses have many rooms. There is usually a bedroom for sleeping.
There is often a kitchen for cooking. There is usually a bathroom. There is often a living room for sitting
and talking. Some houses have basements. The basement is under the main part of the house. Some
houses have attics. The attic is above the main part of the house. Most houses have a door so people
can enter and exit the house. Most houses have windows so the people can look outside. Windows also
let air into the house from outdoors. Some houses are fancy. They are painted bright colors, and are
very decorative. Some houses not fancy "" they are plain and simple. Houses look very different in
different parts of the world. But, people who live in a house probably all agree that there is no place like
home!"	Susan Carter
