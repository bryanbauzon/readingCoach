BY THE WATER	"I live in a house by the water. I sit by the water each day. I take my bag there with me. In it, I pack a book
and a blanket. I also carry a chair and a basket of food. I walk down my back steps and sit in the same
spot along the grass. When I go out to the water in the morning, I am alone. I hear the water. I see the
boats. I feel calm. It is the part of the day I like best. Later, some children come to play by the water. It is
afternoon. I hear them laughing. I see them play ball. “Nestor, Nestor!” the children yell when they see
me on the beach. I wave and smile. “Play ball with us, Nestor!” the children shout. “No, thanks,” I say. &quot;I
am too old to play ball. I walk with a cane and my hands are no longer good at catching.&quot; I try to read my
book, but it is hard with all the noise. I watch mothers and fathers fish along the shore. I am happy. I
hear the water. I see the boats. I eat my lunch. Later, the sky gets dark. I gather all of my things and go
back to the house. I get in bed. I hear the water through my open window. The sound puts me to sleep."	Susan Carter
