NIAGARA FALLS	"In 1901 people came to Niagara Falls to see Anna Taylor. She was going to go over the falls in a barrel. No one had tried such a thing. It was very dangerous. First there were the rapids above the fall and then there was a drop of 50 meters (165 feet). 

People watched as Anna crawled into her barrel. They saw it sealed and let loose. Then the barrel disappeared in the rapids. Finally it reappeared. Then it hung on the edge to the falls. Slowly it tumbled over. People rushed to End out what had happened. They saw the barrel drifting in the river. Then Anna appeared from inside and waved. She had gone over Niagara Falls and lived!
