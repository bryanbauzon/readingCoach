"Marco Polo was born in 1254 in the Venetian Republic. The city of Venice, Italy was at the center of the
Venetian Republic. When he was 17 years old, he went to China with his father, Niccolo, and his uncle,
Maffeo. Pope Gregory X sent them to visit Kublai Khan, the emperor of China. Kublai Khan liked Marco
Polo. He enjoyed Marco Polo's stories about many lands. Kublai Khan gave Marco Polo a job. He sent
Polo on diplomatic missions. He also made him governor of Yangzhou, an important trading city. When
Marco Polo went back to the Venetian Republic, he talked about his life in China. Few believed his
stories. In 1298, he went to jail during a war between Venice and Genoa. While he was a prisoner in jail,
he dictated his stories about China to another man in jail. The man wrote down the stories. The stories
became the book, "The Travels of Marco Polo." Each chapter of the book covers a specific region of
China. Each chapter is about the military, farming, religion, and culture of a certain area. The book was
translated into many languages. Marco Polo got out of jail in 1299. He went back to Venice to join his
father and uncle. He became very rich. In 1300 he got married, and he and his wife had three children.
Marco Polo died in 1324. He was almost 70 years old."
