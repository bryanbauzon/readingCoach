	"Yellowstone National Park is in the U.S. states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. It became the first
National Park in 1872. There are geysers and hot springs at Yellowstone. There are also many animals at
Yellowstone. There are elk, bison, sheep, grizzly bears, black bears, moose, coyotes, and more. More
than 3 million people visit Yellowstone National Park each year. During the winter, visitors can ski or go
snowmobiling there. There are also snow coaches that give tours. Visitors can see steam (vapor water)
come from the geysers. During other seasons, visitors can go boating or fishing. People can ride horses
there. There are nature trails and tours. Most visitors want to see Old Faithful, a very predictable geyser
at Yellowstone. Visitors can check a schedule to see the exact time that Old Faithful is going to erupt.
There are many other geysers and boiling springs in the area. Great Fountain Geyser erupts every 11
hours. Excelsior Geyser produces 4,000 gallons of boiling water each minute! Boiling water is 100
degrees Celsius, or 212 degrees Fahrenheit ' that's very hot! People also like to see the Grand Prismatic
Spring. It is the largest hot spring in the park. It has many beautiful colors. The beautiful colors are
caused by bacteria in the water. These are forms of life that have only one cell. Different bacteria live in
different water temperatures. Visiting Yellowstone National Park can be a week'long vacation or more.
It is beautiful, and there are activities for everyone."
