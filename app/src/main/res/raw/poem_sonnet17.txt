Who in the future will ever believe my poetry if I praise you as you deserve? Though, I have to admit,
my poetry is like a tomb that actually hides what you are really like and doesn’t manage to show
even half of your true qualities. If I could capture in my writing how beautiful your eyes are and
create new verses to list all of your wonderful attributes, decades from now people would say, “This
poet lies. No human face was ever so divine.” In this way, my poems (yellowed with age), would be
scorned, like old men who talk too much without saying anything true, and what is really your due
would be dismissed as a poet’s madness, the false verses of an old song. But if some child of yours
were still alive then, you would live twice: in the child, and in my poetry.
