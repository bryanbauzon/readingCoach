Did you know that dragons really do exist? These dragons, however, cannot fly, and donï¿½t breathe fire. These dragons are called komodo dragons. Komodo dragons live on a few small islands in Indonesia, which is in Asia. Komodo dragons are huge reptiles that can grow to ten feet long and weigh 350 pounds. Their tails make up half of the lengths of their bodies. These interesting animals smell with their tongues. Komodo dragons are carnivores. They bite prey with deadly saliva and then wait for the animal to die. This may take several days. Komodo dragons, however, are very patient. They only eat a few times per month!
