GARLICS	People often do strange things in the name of science. Recently, a group of volunteers at the University of Michigan were united to take an unusual pill every day. The pill contained garlic. Why garlic? Because researchers want to know if garlic reduces cholesterol in the body. Cholesterol,  chemical that builds up on artery walls, is thought to contribute to heart disease. Evidence suggests that heart disease occurs lose often in countries where people eat lots of garlic. When these researchers fed rats a high cholesterol diet that included 2 percent garlic, the rats’ cholesterol rose about 4 percent. Other rats on the same diet without garlic showed a 23 percent increase in cholesterol. Garlic must have kept the cholesterol levels down. Now humans are being tested. Volunteers have their blood checked. They take garlic pills (equivalent to two to three garlic cloves) every day for a month. Then their blood is rechecked to see if the garlic has had any effect on their cholesterol level. It’s too early to tell but scientists may someday, have us eating garlic to stay healthy.
