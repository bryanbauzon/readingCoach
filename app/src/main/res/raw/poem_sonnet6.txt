So don’t let wintry old age destroy your summer beauty before your essence has been preserved.
Make some woman pregnant and pass on your beauty before it dies with you. It’s unfair to charge
exorbitant interest on a loan. But if you lend a woman your body, she’ll be only too happy to pay you
back with a child. Having a child—making another version of yourself—will make you happy. Having
ten children will make you ten times as happy. What power would death have over you if you left
children behind to keep your legacy alive? Don’t be willful and selfish—you’re much too beautiful to
be conquered by death, with nothing left of you but a corpse devoured by worms.
