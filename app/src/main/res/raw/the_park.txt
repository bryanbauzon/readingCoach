"Reem likes to go to the park with her mom. She likes to play at the park with her friends. Today when
Reem goes to the park, she looks around and becomes very sad. "What is wrong, Reem?" Mom asks.
"There is so much trash on the ground," Reem says. "It seems like each day, I see more trash here."
Reem and her mom look around. There are old boxes on the ground. There are popped balloons on the
ground. There are old cans, too. "You are right," Mom says. "The park is very dirty." "What can we do?"
Reem asks. "I am sure you will think of something," Mom says. Reem and her mom go home. Reem
paints a picture of a park. She uses blue, green, brown, and yellow paint. PLEASE KEEP OUR PARK CLEAN,
she writes in big letters on top of her picture. "Let"s go back to the park, Mom," Reem says. "Okay,"
Mom says. Reem grabs a bunch of trash bags to take with her. She also brings along some tape. When
Reem gets to the park, she tapes her picture on a big trash can. "Here you go!" she says to her mom.
She hands her mom a bag. "Will you help me pick up the trash?" "I sure will," Mom says. The children at
the park run over to see what is going on. Reem hands them bags. "Let"s clean this place up," she says.
The children pick up lots of trash. They talk and laugh as they work. Soon all the bags are full. "We need
to come back another day. There is still some trash on the ground," Reem says. "But the park looks
much better." "It does," Mom says. "I knew you would think of some way to help.""
