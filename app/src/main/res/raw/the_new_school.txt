"Tracey is starting a new school today. She is very sad. She is very scared. "I don"t want to go to
school today," Tracey tells her dad. "I understand, sweetheart," Dad says. "Starting a new
school can be very scary." Tracey has moved to a new town. She has moved to a new house.
She is starting a new school today. She has done all of this in a week! "I feel sick," Tracey says.
"My stomach hurts. I can"t eat breakfast." "I think that is because you are nervous," Dad says.
He pats Tracey"s hair. He gives her a little hug. "Try drinking just a little juice. Then I will walk
you to school." Tracey and her dad walk to school. Tracey thinks about many things. Will I make
friends? Will I like my teacher? What if I don"t know the answer to a question? Will kids laugh at
me? What if no one likes me? "We"re here," says Dad. Tracey looks up at the big building. Her
other school was small. Tracey wishes she could run away. She knows she cannot. She takes a
deep breath. She walks up the steps to school. She walks into her third grade classroom. "That
must be Tracey," she hears a boy say. "Hello, Tracey!" "Welcome, Tracey!" "Let me show you
around." Everyone seems kind. Tracey feels a little better. Bu she is still not happy. She is still a
little scared. She cannot eat her lunch. Dad picks Tracey up after school. "How was your day?"
he asks. "Okay," she says. "It will get better," Dad says. "Big changes are hard." "I know," says
Tracey. She reaches for her dad"s hand to hold as they walk home."
