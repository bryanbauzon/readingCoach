BEDS	"A long time ago, people didn’t sleep in beds. Ten thousand years ago, people probably slept on leaves
and animal furs. Long ago in Egypt, people ate, slept, and talked to friends in bed. Over 3,000 years ago,
King Tut of Egypt had a beautiful bed made of wood and gold! But common people in Egypt slept on
beds of grass and leaves. In the 16th century, in the 1500’s, people piled bird feathers or straw on rope
webs. Later, people made mattresses by stuffing feathers inside large cotton bags. Louis 14th, king of
France from 1643 until 1715, had 413 beds. He liked to talk to his friends and do his work in bed. He
liked beautiful beds. In 1865, people started to put springs under their mattress to make it more flexible.
This would make it bend and flex when the sleeper moved. By the 1930’s, most beds had springs. About
100 years after people started to put springs under their mattress, the modern waterbed was invented.
Today there are different kinds of beds. Some people have waterbeds. Some sleep on mats. Others
sleep on foam mattresses or airbeds."	Susan Carter
