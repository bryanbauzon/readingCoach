"
The sweetest apples often have little tunnels inside-tunnels made by little worms. 
How did worms get there? ln the middle of summer a special kind of fly lands on the apple. She pokes a sharp tube on her stomach into the fruit. Eggs slide through the tube into the apple. From the eggs come worms that eat the fruit. 
ln autumn when the apples fall to the ground, the worms crawl out, and a hard case forms around each one. That is the worms winter home. Inside the case the worm turns into a fly. and next summer the fly comes out of its case just as apples are growing sweet.
