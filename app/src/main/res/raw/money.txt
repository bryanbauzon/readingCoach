"Nine thousand years ago, people did not have money. They traded animals for things they wanted. They
traded crops for what they wanted. In China, in about 1200 B.C., people traded shells for the things they
wanted. Chinese people also traded metal tools for the things they wanted. For example, they traded
metal knives and shovels for the things they wanted. Later in China, people made metal money. In about
100 B.C., the Chinese made money of animal skin. The first paper money was made from white colored
deer skin. It came from China about 900 years later. In about 700 B.C., people made the first round
metal coins. The coins were made of gold and silver. They looked very similar to the coins we use today.
These coins came from Lydia. Lydia was located where the country called Turkey is located today. After
people made coins in Lydia, people in Rome, Iran, and Greece also began making coins. Coins were very
durable ' they were strong and could last a long time without becoming damaged. Wampum are
necklaces made from beads and seashells. The beads had holes in them. People put beads on strings.
American Indians used wampum for money in the 1500's. Money changes with time. No matter what it
looks like, money is an idea. It is the thought that people can trade something they have for something
they want. Money makes trading easier."
