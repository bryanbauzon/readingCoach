Your face is as pretty as a woman’s, but you don’t even have to use makeup—you, the man (or
should I say woman?) I love. Your heart is as gentle as a woman’s, but it isn’t cheating like theirs.
Your eyes are prettier than women’s, but not as roving—you bless everything you look at. You’ve got
the good looks of a handsome man, but you attract both women and men. When Mother Nature
made you, she originally intended to make you a woman, but then she got carried away with her
creation and screwed me by adding a certainthing that I have no use for. But since she gave you a
prick to please women, I’ll keep your love, and they can enjoy your body.
