Maddy loves to jump rope, ride her scooter, and ride her skateboard. One day, Maddy gets a hole in the shoes she likes best while riding her scooter. They are pink with hearts and a Velcro tab. Now she needs new shoes. Maddy's mom takes her to the department store on Saturday morning. The store is filled with people looking for shirts, dresses, pants, and toys. Maddy's mom takes her to the shoe area. The shoe area is crowded, and there is a long wait. Maddy does not mind. Maddy sees a pair of purple sneakers with orange laces. She sees a pair of red sandals with dots. She sees a pair of green flip-flops. She wants the purple sneakers. "But you do not know how to tie your laces," says Maddy's mom. "I will learn," says Maddy. Maddy's mother thinks. She does not want to tie Maddy's laces each morning before school. "If we buy the purple sneakers, you must learn to tie them before you can wear them to school," says Maddy's mom. "I will! I promise!" says Maddy. She is very happy. Maddy practices tying her laces for the rest of the day. She practices more on Sunday. Finally, she learns how to tie her laces. She gets to wear her new shoes to school on Monday. "I did it," she says with a big smile.
