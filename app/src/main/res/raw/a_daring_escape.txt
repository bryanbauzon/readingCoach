"It was 1843. A coach stopped in from of the host hotel in Charleston. South Carolina. The hotel man
some out to moot his new guests.
A block servant opened the coach door. in the coach not the servant's master. A young white man. He
wore green glasses and was well dressed. He appeared to be a rich young planter. But it seemed he had
been hurt. One arm was bandaged. Another bandage covered part of his face.
The young man presented himself. He was William Johnson, he said. He had had an accident while
travelling. The hotel man was sorry to hear it. Johnson's servant and the hotel man helped him inside.
At the hotel desk there was a book to sign. But this guest could not sign it. His arm was hurt. �That�s all
right," said the hotel man. "I'll put your name in the book."
Johnson's servant helped him to his room. The door closed behind them. There William Johnson took off
the bandages. The dark glasses came off too. The "young planter" was really Ellen Craft, a black woman!
She was escaping from slavery in Georgia. Her "servant" was really her husband, William Craft. They
were on their way North. In the North there was no slavery. They would be free there.
It was dangerous to go North. Slaves could not travel unless their owners allowed it. The Crafts had had
to plan their escape very carefully.
Ellen&#39;s skin was very light. People had often thought that she was white. For their escape she would cut
her hair short and dress as a man. She would pretend to be a white slave owner. William would act as
her slave. Then no one would stop them.
But Ellen could not read or write. What if someone asked her to write her name? She would pretend
that her arm was hurt! She&#39;d bandage it. Then no one would expect her to write. Another bandage on
her face would help keep people from seeing who she was. It was a daring plan. Ellen and William were
afraid. But they wanted to be free.
They began to buy pieces of clothing they would need. They kept these hidden. Ellen had to make the
trousers she would wear. She did it secretly. William found a pair of dark glasses for Ellen. At last they
were ready.
They started their trip by train. Ellen looked round the train car. Oh, no! There was Mr. Gray, a friend of
her master! Surely he would see her. Mr. Cray looked straight at Ellen. But he did not know who she
was.
There were many such moments.
There was much to fear. But at last they reached Boston. They were free!"
