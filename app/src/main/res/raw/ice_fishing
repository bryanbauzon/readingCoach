The first tip for a good day of ice fishing is to wear the right clothes. You should dress in layers. Wear 2 or 3 shirts, so you can take off a layer when you are warm. Wear a face mask, a warm hat with ear flaps over your ears, and warm gloves and boots. The second tip is to stay warm. Some people put up cloth tents when they go ice fishing. Some people own small ice houses where they can stay warm. You can use a small heater inside the tent or outside on the ice. Be sure to take a hot drink like hot chocolate. You should move around to stay warm. Some people take ice skates. The third tip is to check the ice. Look at it carefully. The ice must be 4 or more inches thick. This is the ice rule: “Thick and blue, tried and true. Thin and crispy, way too risky.” Thick ice is safe for ice fishing. Thin ice is dangerous. The fourth tip is to take the right tools. You need to drill a hole in the ice with an ice drill. Then make the hole bigger with a chopping tool, like an ax. You need to carry your bait in a bait bucket. Use worms or small fish for bait. You need a chair to sit on. Take a folding chair so you can carry it easily. Be sure to take your fish hooks and fishing rod! Pull all your tools on a sled. Take your cell phone. You might need to call for help. The fifth tip is to have a great time!
