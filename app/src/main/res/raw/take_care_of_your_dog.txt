"Let"s say you have a pet dog. Let"s Say her name is Cleo. She"s one of the family. So take good care of
her. You"ll both be happier if you do. So will the rest of the family. Here are some things to keep in mind.
(They'll help even if your dog isn"t named Cleo.)
First, you must train her. You must teach her good manners. That will help her to get along with people.
Be patient. But be firm. Always stick to the same rules. Don"t let Cleo do something wrong just this
once." She has to know what the rules are.
When she makes a mistake, don"t yell at her. Don"t hit her. Don"t make her go without food. Say, "NO!
NO!" in a firm voice.
Don"t call her when you have to scold her. Instead, go to her. You don"t want her to be afraid to come
to you.
She wants your love. She wants to please you. So always show her when you"re pleased.
Keep her clean and neat. That will make her look good and feel good. Brush her coat and run your
fingers through her fur. Then you"ll find any ticks or burrs she"s picked up.
Look at her eyes. They shouldn"t be runny. Look at her ears. They might need cleaning.
In summer she"ll spend more time outdoors. When it"s hot, make sure she has a cool, shady place to
rest. Make sure she always has a dish of fresh water.
Be very careful about leaving her in a parked car. Even when the windows are open, a car can get very,
very hot. Dogs can become ill or even die when they"re very hot. If Cleo ever becomes ill, do as the vet
says. Let her rest in a quiet place. Don"t play with her. Just pat her head and let her know you care.
Remember that your pet is your special friend. Talk to her and Hug her. Let her play with you and your
other friends. The more you treat her like a "furry person," the better friends you"ll be."
