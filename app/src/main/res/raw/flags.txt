FLAGS	"The first flags were probably in China. People flew flags in China over 4,000 years ago. Each part of the
army had its own flag so the soldiers could see their leaders. Early flags were sticks of wood. They had
pictures cut into the wood. Iran had metal flags about 3,000 years ago. Old Greek coins show pictures of
flags. People in Rome also used flags over 2,000 years ago. People first made flags of cloth about 2,000
years ago. Those flags looked like today’s flags. Flags are important at sea. Most ships fly their own
country’s flag and the flag of the country they are visiting. When a ship flies only its own flag, it is ready
to fight. Every country now has a flag. Every U.S. state has a flag. Clubs, teams, and schools have flags.
The Olympics has a flag. The Olympics flag has five rings of five colors. Each ring stands for, or
represents, a continent. It means that people from five continents – Africa, Asia, Europe, North America,
and South America – come to play. Railway lines also use flags. Railway flags tell the trains what to do.
For example, a red flag tells the train to stop, just like a stop sign. A blue, white, or green flag tells the
train that it can go. A blue flag on the side of a train means someone is working on the train. It means
nobody can move the train."	Susan Carter
