	"It is Levi"s birthday. He has a party at home with his family. Everyone sings, "Happy Birthday!" Levi has
nine candles on his cake. He blows them out. He opens his presents. Levi"s mother and father give him a
bicycle. Levi"s little sister gives him a game. Levi"s uncle gives him a baseball jersey. Levi"s grandma and
grandpa give him 20 dollars! &quot;Thank you!&quot; he yells to everyone. Levi is excited. He likes all his presents.
He likes the 20 dollars best. It means he can go to the store. He can buy anything he wants! "Can we go
to the store now, Mom?" asks Levi. Mom frowns. "Levi, your guests are still here. I will take you to the
store tomorrow." That night, Levi dreams of all the things he might buy with his 20 dollars. Maybe I will
buy a video game! Maybe I will buy a guitar! Maybe I will buy a camera! Maybe I will buy a tool kit! In
the morning, Mom takes Levi and his little sister to the store. "Will you buy me something, too?" asks
Levi"s little sister. "Maybe," Levi says. He runs to look around the store. Ugh! The guitar costs more than
20 dollars. The video game costs more than 20 dollars. The camera costs more than 20 dollars. The tool
kit costs 12 dollars. Levi buys the tool kit. He buys his little sister a key chain. He buys his mom a pack of
gum. "You are a sweet boy," Levi"s mom tells him."
