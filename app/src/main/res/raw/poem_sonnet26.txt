My love, I am your absolute servant; your worth compels me to serve you loyally. I’m sending you
this message to show my devotion to you, not to show that I can write well. My skills are so poor that
I may make my obligation to you, which is great, seem meager. I don’t have the words to express it
properly. But I hope that in your heart you’ll form an idea of what I mean and the idea will enrich your
sense of what I owe you. When the star that guides me shines on me favorably, giving me the
inspiration to dress up my tattered love for you in clever words that prove I’m worthy of your sweet
respect—that’s when I’ll dare to boast about how much I love you. Until then, I won’t show my face
anywhere that you can put me to the test.
