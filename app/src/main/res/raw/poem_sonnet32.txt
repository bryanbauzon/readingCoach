If you survive me, living on after dust covers my bones, and you should happen to read over again
these poor, crude sonnets written by the man who once loved you, remember that things have
improved since my day. So even though any poet today could write better sonnets, keep my poems
for the sake of my love, not for my skill, which luckier men have far surpassed. And grant me this
loving thought: “If my friend’s inspiration was paired with the advantages today’s poets have, his love
would have brought forth better poems than these, to rank alongside those of today’s better poets.
But since he died, and poets are better now, I’ll read their poems for their style, his for his love.”
