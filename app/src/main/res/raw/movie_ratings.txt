"A PG-13 rating is an advisory issued by the Ratings Board to parents to determine whether children
under age 13 should view the motion picture, as some material might not be suitable for them. A PG-13
motion picture may go beyond the PG rating in theme, violence, nudity, sensuality, language, adult
activities or other elements, but does not reach the restricted R category. The theme of the motion
picture by itself will not result in a rating greater than PG-13, although depictions of activities related to
a mature theme may result in a restricted rating for the motion picture. Any drug use will initially
require at least a PG-13 rating. More than brief nudity will require at least a PG-13 rating, but such
nudity in a PG-13 rated motion picture generally will not be sexually oriented. There may be depictions
of violence in a PG-13 movie, but generally not both realistic and extreme or persistent violence. A
motion pictureï¿½s single use of one of the harsher sexually-derived words, though only as an expletive,
initially requires at least a PG-13 rating. More than one such usage requires an R rating. Nevertheless,
the Ratings Board may rate such a motion picture PG-13 if, based on a special vote by a two-thirds
majority, the Raters feel that most American parents would believe that a PG-13 rating is appropriate
because of the context or manner in which the words are used or because the use of those words in the
motion picture is inconspicuous."
