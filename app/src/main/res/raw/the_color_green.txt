THE COLOR GREEN
By

Green is a beautiful color! In nature, the grass that you walk on is green and the leaves that you see on trees are usually green. Most of the plants that you see are green too! Frogs are green and many grasshoppers are green too. Turtles are different shades of green. Did you know that you can make green paint by mixing blue and yellow? Because you can make green my mixing two primary colors, it is called a secondary color. Green is also the name used to describe the movement to make products that do not harm the Earth. Green products are often those made from recycled materials or those that are safe to throw out in the trash.
