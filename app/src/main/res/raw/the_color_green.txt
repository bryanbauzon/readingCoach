Frogs are green and many grasshoppers are green too. Turtles are different shades of green. Did you know that you can make green paint by mixing blue and yellow? Because you can make green my mixing two primary colors, it is called a secondary color. Green is also the name used to describe the movement to make products that do not harm the Earth.
