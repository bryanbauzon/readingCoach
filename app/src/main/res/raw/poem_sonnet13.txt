Oh, how I wish you were yourself! But, my love, your identity will only last as long as you’re alive.
You should make preparations in anticipation of your inevitable death and pass on your beautiful
appearance to someone else. That way, your beauty, which you’ve only borrowed, wouldn’t have to
end. Then, even after you died, your beautiful body would be renewed in your children. Who would
let such a beautiful house fall into disrepair when prudent maintenance might make it outlast the
stormy gusts of winter and the frustrating barrenness surrounding death? Only the most
irresponsible spender could do such a thing, you know, my dear love. You had a father—let your son
be able to say the same.
