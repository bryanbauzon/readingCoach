"Tennis is a sport played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players (doubles).
Each player uses a tennis racket to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt. To win, you must hit the
ball into the opponent's court without the opponent being able to hit the ball back. Tennis originated in
the United Kingdom in the late 19th century. At first, people played tennis on courts made of grass!
These were called 'lawn courts'. Now, tennis is played by millions of people all over the world. The rules
of tennis have changed very little since it was created in the 1890s. Most tennis players play tennis
because it is fun. It also is a good way to get exercise. While playing tennis, you do a lot of running. You
move your arms and legs in many ways that they do not normally move."
