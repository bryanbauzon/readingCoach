THE LION AND THE MOUSE	A lion, tired from chasing his prey lay sleeping under a nice, shady tree. Some mice, scrambling over him while he slept, awoke him. The lion was upset and lay his paw on one of the mice. The mouse begged for mercy so sadly that the lion let him go. A few days later, the same lion found himself caught in a hunter’s net. He could not get loose. He roared in anger. The mouse whose life he had saved heard this and came. How could a little mouse help a big, strong lion? His sharp little teeth chewed through the ropes and soon the lion was free.	Jerry Pinkney
