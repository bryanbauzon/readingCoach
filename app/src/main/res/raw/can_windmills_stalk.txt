CAN WINDMILLS TALK?	"Do you know what a windmill is? Look at the picture. It shows a windmill. Most windmills have four
arms, like the mill you see here. When the wind blows, it turns those arms. This turns a big stone inside
the mill. The stone grinds grain. It turns the grain into flour. Farmers bring their grain to the mill. The
miller makes it into flour. Then people bake bread with the flour. There are many windmills like these in
Holland.

can talk with their arms. Here"s how it works.
