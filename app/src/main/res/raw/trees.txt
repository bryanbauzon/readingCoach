TREES	"Trees have three parts. Trees have roots. The roots pull up water and food for the tree from
underground. Trees have a trunk. The trunk is the stem of the tree. It has bark on it. It helps food get to
the branches. Trees have a crown. The crown is at the top of the tree. Branches, leaves, seeds, and
flowers are all part of the crown."	Susan Carter
