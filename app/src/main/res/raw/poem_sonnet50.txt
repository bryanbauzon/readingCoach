I feel very depressed as I go on my journey, because I know when I get where I’m going I’ll have
time and leisure to rest, and when I have that time to rest I’ll have nothing to think about except “I’m
this many miles away from my friend.” The horse that carries me, affected by my sadness, plods
slowly on, bearing the weight of my emotions, as if by some instinct the poor creature knew that I
didn’t want to move quickly away from you. I can’t provoke him to go any faster with the bloody spur
that I sometimes thrust into his hide in anger. He only answers me with a groan, which hurts me
more than my spur hurts him, because it reminds me that my grief lies ahead of me and all my joy is
behind me.
