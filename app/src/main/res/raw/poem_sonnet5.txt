The same process that over time shaped your wonderful face, so that now everybody loves to look
at you, will eventually destroy that face, making ugly what is now surpassingly beautiful. For never-
resting Time takes summer by the hand, leads him into horrifying winter, and destroys him
there—freezing his sap, removing his full leaves, covering up his beauty with snow, and turning
everything bare. If we didn’t have perfume distilled from summer flowers to keep in a jar, the effects
of summer would vanish at the end of the season. Without perfume, we’d have no way of
remembering the summer itself or its beauty. But the flowers used to make perfume lose only their
outward beauty when winter comes; their beautiful scent lives on sweetly.
