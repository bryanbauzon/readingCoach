TELEVISIONS	"Many people worked to create television. In 1862, Abbe Giovanna Caselli invented a machine called the
Pantelograph. Caselli was the first person to send a picture over wires. By the 1880s, Alexander Graham
Bell invented a machine that transmitted pictures and sound over wires. His machine was called the
Photophone. The World’s Fair was held in Paris, France, in the year 1900. The first International
Congress of Electricity was held at the World’s Fair. That was when the word television was first used –
by a Russian named Constantin Perskyi. That name stuck, and is now shortened to “TV.” At the
beginning of TV history, there were several types of TV technology. One system was a mechanical model
based on a rotating disc. (Rotating discs are discs that spin like CDs.) The other system was an electronic
model. In 1906, Boris Rosing built the first working mechanical TV in Russia. In the 1920s, John Logie
Baird in England and Charles Francis Jenkins in the United States demonstrated improved mechanical
systems. Philo Taylor Farnsworth also showed an electronic system in San Francisco in 1927. His TV was
the forerunner of today’s TV, which is an electronic system based on his ideas. Now TV is everywhere.
Before 1947, there were only a few thousand televisions in the U.S. By the 1990s, there were televisions
in 98% of American homes."	Susan Carter
