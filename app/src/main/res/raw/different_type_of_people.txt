People can be different in many ways, but in one way we're all alike. All of us need to eat. What we like to eat can be very different. Some Mongolians like to drink sour horse's milk. But give them some coffee and they run for water to wash the bad taste from their mouths. Some Chinese like a certain worm that is 0 fried until crisp. They eat it like salted nuts. But they think that sugar. milk, or lemon in tea is awful. ln another part of the world people think food that comes in tins is not fit to eat. It's all a matter of what were used to!.
