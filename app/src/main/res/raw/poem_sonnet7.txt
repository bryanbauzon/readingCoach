When the gracious light of the sun rises in the east, each person on earth pays homage to it by
gazing upon all its sacred majesty. And even at noon, once the sun has climbed the steep path to
the top of the sky, it still looks like a strong young man in his prime and human beings still adore its
beauty, watching it pass on its way like a golden king making a pilgrimage. But when the sun grows
weary and falls from its highest point, it reels like an old man, and the people who once looked up at
it so dutifully stop looking and turn the other way. In the same way, you, wasting your sexual energy
in the prime of your life, will die alone and unloved unless you father a son.
