"Two of the best-known shelters of North American Indians were wigwams and tepees. The Ojibwa of the Great Lakes built wigwams. Saplings (young trees) were stuck in a circle in the ground. Then they were bent inward and tied at the top. More saplings were bent in circles around the outside of the frame. Then the frame was covered with tree bark.
 
Great Plains Indians built tepees, cone-shaped tents. Since they moved often hunting buffalo, they needed a shelter that could be moved easily. Indian women made and put up the tepees. They leaned poles against one another and tied them on top. They covered the frame with buffalo skins that they had sewn together. The skins could he pulled back from the top to let out smoke from a tire inside.
