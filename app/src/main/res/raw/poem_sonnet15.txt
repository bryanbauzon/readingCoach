When I think about the fact that every living thing is perfect only for a brief time, that the whole world
is one big stage on which the stars secretly control the action; when I see that men grow like plants,
encouraged and then thwarted by the same sky, exulting in their youthful vigor and then declining
just when they’re at their height, vanishing until their glory is no longer even remembered; when I
think about the whole world’s instability—then I think of you, a youth enjoying so many of nature’s
rich gifts. In my mind, I see time and decay debating with each other about how to corrupt your
sunny youth, how to convert it to old age and night. Out of love for you, I wage war against time: As
he takes away your youth, I continually recreate you in these poems.
