"Benjamin Franklin was born in 1706 in Boston, Massachusetts. He came from a big family. He had 16
brothers and sisters. When Benjamin was 15, his brother started the first Boston newspaper. It was
called The New England Courant. He worked for the newspaper for a short time, but he was not happy.
So, he went to Philadelphia and worked as a printer. In 1729, he bought a newspaper business. The
newspaper was the Pennsylvania Gazette. He was very busy. In 1733, he started publishing Poor
Richard"s Almanac. His pen name (the name he used as an author) was Richard Saunders. This book
came out every year. Almanacs have information about weather and crops. They also have wise sayings.
The wise saying "A penny saved is a penny earned" comes from Poor Richard"s Almanac. Benjamin
Franklin was also an inventor. In 1743 he invented a very good stove called the Franklin stove. He
invented swim fins. He invented bifocal glasses. He also invented the first odometer. He retired from his
newspaper business in 1749. He stopped working on it. Then he became busy with science. Benjamin
Franklin was also very interested in American politics. He helped Thomas Jefferson write the Declaration
of Independence. In 1776, he and other people signed the Declaration of Independence. Franklin died
on April 17, 1790. He was 84 years old."
