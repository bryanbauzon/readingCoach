	"The heart is a part of your body. The heart is just slightly to the left of the center of your chest. The heart
makes the blood move through your body. If you press your ear against someone&#39;s chest, you can hear
the heart beating. The heart is very important. To keep it healthy and strong, it is good to eat right and
exercise. The heart is also a well-known symbol for love. It is pictured on love letters and valentines."
