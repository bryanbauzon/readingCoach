"
People taste different things on different parts of the tongue. If something is sweet, like candy, we taste
it on the tip of our tongues. If something is salty, like potato chips, we taste it just behind the tip. If
something is sour, like a lemon, we taste it on the sides of our tongues. We taste bitter things, like dark
chocolate, at the back of our tongues."
