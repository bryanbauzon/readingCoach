Sun, why did you make it look like today was going to be such a beautiful day, so that I went out
without my cloak, only to let nasty clouds overtake me on my way, hiding your radiance behind their
poisonous mist? It’s not enough that you broke through the clouds and dried the rain off my storm-
beaten face, because no man can be satisfied with a cure that heals the physical injury but doesn’t
take away the disgrace. Nor does it comfort me that you’re ashamed, because even though you
regret what you did, I have still lost out. When someone takes something away from you, their being
sorry doesn’t help much. Ah, but those tears you’re shedding out of love for me are like pearls—very
valuable ones—and they make up for all your bad deeds.
