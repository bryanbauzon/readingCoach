Africa has many kinds of land areas. Deserts, forests, grasslands, and mountains are all found there. Deserts cover more than a third of the land. The Sahara, its largest desert, is in the north. The land there is sand and bare rock. There is little water. Grasslands cover part of the land. These have some small trees. The grass may grow almost four meters (twelve feet) high. This happens when it rains. Africa also has different kinds of weather. It is hot near the equator. It can be cold in the mountains and in the south. Some places have a great deal at rain, but some parts have almost no rain at all.
