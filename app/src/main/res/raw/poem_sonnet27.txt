Weary from work, I hasten to my bed, the sweet place of rest for a body tired out from laboring. But
then I start to go on a journey in my head, making my mind work after my body’s work is finished.
Because when I go to bed, my thoughts begin the trip from where I am, far away from you, to where
you are. They keep my weary eyes wide open, staring at the darkness like blind people do. Except,
in my imagination, I see your image, though it’s too dark to see anything else. Like a shining jewel
hanging in the terrifying night, your image makes that old, black night look beautiful and young. See,
because of you, my body does not rest in the daytime and my mind finds no peace at night.
