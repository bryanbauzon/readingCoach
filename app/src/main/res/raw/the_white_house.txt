"The White House is the home and office of the President of the United States. The White House is
located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. The first president to live in the White House
was John Adams. He moved into the White House in 1800. Now President Barack Obama lives in the
White House. An architect named James Hoban made the plans for the White House. Hoban won a
design contest held by Pierre Charles L�Enfant. L�Enfant was the main architect for the capital city of
Washington, D.C. The White House was built between 1792 and 1800. It was built of limestone and
painted white. During the War of 1812, the British Army set fire to the White House. President James
Madison moved out while the house was rebuilt. In 1817, James Monroe moved into the White House.
At first, people called the building the �President�s Palace.� However, because kings and queens live in
palaces, �President�s Palace� was not a good name for the house. President Theodore Roosevelt gave
the building the name it has today � The White House."
