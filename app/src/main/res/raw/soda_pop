The machine was the “soda fountain.” They called the new bubbly water “soda water” or “carbonated water.” American drug stores sold soda water. Druggists put good-tasting flavors in the soda water. People drank soda water for their health. Many people liked it for its good flavor. Many people went to the soda fountain every day. Most soda fountains were in drug stores or ice cream shops.
