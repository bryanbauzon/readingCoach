Dandelions are good to eat! For years, people in all parts oi the world have eaten them. They use the young spring leaves of the plant. Some people boil them and eat them with salt and pepper. Some people use them in salads. These spring leaves are called dandelion greens. The dandelion got its name in a strange way. Each dandelion leaf has rough edges that look like a row of teeth. 30 long ago, the peeple of France gave the plant the name dent de lion, which means lions tooth. But to the peeple of England, the name sounded like dandelion. And thats what they called this little plant.
