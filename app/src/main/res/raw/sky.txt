SKY	Yam is my mother. Tonton is my father. My name is Shy. We live in a red house. We have a blue car. We sit in the yard at night. We look at the sky. Father says the sky make him happy. Mother says the sky make her want to sing. I like to think about how beautiful is the sky . We hear a baby cry next door. My mother sings. The baby stops crying. We think he heard my mother’s pretty song. We all smile.	Craig Benjamin
