"Leonard James is a homeless man. For him, life is always hard. He is always hungry. His shoes have holes
in them. He needs a haircut. His clothes are old and dirty. "What I would do with one hundred dollars!"
Leonard says. This is a game he likes to play with himself to take his mind off things. He is walking down
the street on a Thursday night. The winter air is cold on his face. "If I had one hundred dollars, I could
buy new socks," he says. He continues to walk down the street. "If I had one hundred dollars, I could get
a haircut," he says. He continues to walk down the street. "If I had one hundred dollars, I could buy new
pants," he says. He continues to walk down the street. "If I had one hundred dollars, I could get a
hamburger," he says. His stomach rumbles at the thought. "If I had"." Leonard looks down at the
sidewalk. He cannot believe what he sees! Someone has lost his wallet. Leonard picks it up. Inside are
five twenty-dollar bills. "One hundred dollars!" Leonard says. He is very excited. "Now I can buy
everything I want!" Then Leonard begins to think. "But this is not my money," he says. Leonard goes to
the police station. He gives a police officer the wallet and money. "Thank you," says the police officer.
"You are a very honest man." Leonard smiles. He turns around and begins to leave the police station.
"Hold on," the police officer says. He reaches in his own pocket and gives Leonard ten dollars. "Get
yourself something to eat.""
