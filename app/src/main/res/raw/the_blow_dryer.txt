THE BLOW DRYER	"A blow dryer is a common household appliance. Have you ever wondered how a blow dryer works?
When you turn on the dryer, a small fan inside the dryer spins. The fan sucks air into the dryer from the
back. The air warms up as it passes across heated coils inside the blow dryer. The warm air blows out
the front of the dryer and dries your hair. This is much faster than using a towel to dry your hair."	Susan Carter
