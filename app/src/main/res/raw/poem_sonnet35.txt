Don’t be upset anymore about what you did. Everything has its bad side: Roses have thorns,
sparkling fountains have mud, the sun and the moon are periodically covered up by clouds and
eclipses, and disgusting worms live in the sweetest flowers. All men do bad things—even me, right
now: As I excuse your transgression by comparing it to other things, I corrupt myself by making
excuses for your misdeeds (more excuses for these little sins than they even require). Because what
I’m doing is taking your sins, which were just physical urges, and putting my mind to work on their
behalf. The person you’ve hurt is now advocating for you—I’m now pleading the case against
myself. I’m so conflicted between love and hate that I can’t resist helping that sweet villain who
bitterly injures me every hour.
