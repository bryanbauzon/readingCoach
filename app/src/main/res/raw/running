Dieter loves to run. He runs in the morning. He runs in the afternoon. He runs in the evening. He runs at night. Dieter loves to run, but it hurts to run. When Dieter runs, it hurts. His legs hurt. His arms hurt. His back hurts. His head hurts. When Dieter runs, his whole body hurts. Then, Dieter starts thinking. He starts dreaming. He dreams about his job. He dreams about his home. He dreams about his family. He dreams about his friends. He dreams about the world. At first, running hurts. No one likes it when it hurts. When it hurts, Dieter dreams about things that do not hurt. This is why Dieter loves running. Running gives him the best dreams. Sometimes, Dieter forgets that he is running. Sometimes, he runs all morning. Sometimes, he runs all afternoon. Sometimes, he runs all night. Dieter runs and dreams.
