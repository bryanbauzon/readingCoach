Let fortunate people boast about their prizes and their titles, while I—who am not lucky enough to
get such rewards—experience unexpected joy in what I honor most: your love. Those courtiers who
enjoy high status because they’re the favorites of great princes are like marigolds. They bloom as
long as the sun shines on them, but their pride is fragile—one frown will kill them. And once a
famous warrior who has painfully endured and won a thousand battles is defeated, he’s stripped of
all his honors, and all of the successes that he worked for are forgotten. How much happier am I,
who love and am loved in a place I cannot leave and from which others cannot remove me.
