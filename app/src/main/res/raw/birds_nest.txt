BIRD'S NEST	"One nest isn't enough for a father house wren. In spring, after he flies north, he builds several nests. 

Then his bubbling song attracts a female. She looks at each of the male's sample nests before finally choosing one. She arranges the twigs to suit herself and lines the nest with feathers. Then she sits on her brown-spotted eggs while the father guards the nest. 

Once the chicks are hatched and big enough to find their own food, the father wren gets busy again. He cleans out the old nest and starts building new ones. He helps raise two or three sets of chicks in a summer, then flies south for a rest.
