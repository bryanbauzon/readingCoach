RAINY DAY	"My name is Mimi. Today is July 5, 2010. Today is a rainy day. I am happy today. Why am I happy? I am
happy because it is raining! Is that strange? Well…maybe. But I like it when it rains. The rain makes me
happy. I like rainy days. I do not like sunny days. I like the sound of the rain. I like the clouds. The clouds
are gray. The clouds are big. I like the rain."	Susan Carter
