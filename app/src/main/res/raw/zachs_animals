My name is Zach. I have a bird. She flies. I have a dog. He is white. I have a pig. He is very dirty. I have a rabbit. She has a lot of hair. Sometimes I feel like I live in a zoo. The name of my bird is Sky. The name of my dog is Snow. The name of my rabbit is Fur Ball. I do not have a name for my pig yet. I want to have a lamb. I want to have a kitten. I want to have a duck. Mom says, “Not yet.” I can’t live without my animals.
