But why not take advantage of a stronger way to fight against this bloody tyrant, Time, and
strengthen yourself in your old age in a happier way than with my useless sonnets? Now your
capacity for pleasure is at its peak, and many virtuous maidens would love to marry you and bear
your children, who would recreate your image much better than any artificial reproduction such as a
painting or poem. The faces of your children will renew your life. Time created you and brought you
to your present state of perfection, but it cannot preserve your inner worth or outer beauty, and
neither can my poetry. Having a baby would preserve your image and ensure that you live on by
your own design.
