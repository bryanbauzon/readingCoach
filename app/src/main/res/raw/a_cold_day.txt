It is a frigid January day in York, Pennsylvania. The temperature is below freezing. Snow is starting to fall. Dr. James turns on the television to check the weather. He must leave for his work at the hospital soon. �Today is going to be very cold,� says the TV weatherman. �Be sure to wear very warm clothes when you go outside. Also, be careful driving on the roads. Snowfall will make them slippery. In fact, if you can stay home today, do it!� Dr. James cannot stay home. Very sick people are waiting to see him at the hospital. He goes to his closet. He takes out the warmest clothes he has. He puts on a sweater, jacket, gloves, socks, boots, and a hat. He opens his front door to go to work. A gust of cold air blows inside. �Wow, it is very cold outside,� Dr. James says. He is from Miami and is not used to the cold. �The weatherman was right!� Before he can drive to work, Dr. James must clear the snow off his car. He does this very fast. He hops in the car. He shivers. His neck feels especially cold. Dr. James drives slowly to work. Everyone else is driving slowly, too. There is a lot of traffic on the road. There are cars in front of and behind him. Suddenly, the cars in front of Dr. James come to a stop. There has been an accident! Dr. James hurries from his car to check on the driver of the car that has swerved off the road. �Is everyone okay?� Dr. James asks. �Yes, yes, we are fine. We slipped on a patch of ice,� the driver says. �This would have been a good day to stay home in bed.�
