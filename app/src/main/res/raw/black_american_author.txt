"Paul Laurence Dunbar was one of the first black American authors to win world fame for stories and poems. He was born in Ohio in 1872. He was the son of former slaves who told him many tales of plantation life. He would use these later in his writing.

Paul was a fine student and the editor of his high school paper. In high school he put out a community newspaper. He did all the writing himself. He signed his articles with different names to keep people from ' knowing that the paper had only a one-man staff. 

In his later writing he often used the rough speech of untaught blacks, for he knew the importance of preserving their ways. He died in 1906, and his poems and stories are still read and enjoyed.
