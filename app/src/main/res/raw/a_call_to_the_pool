My name is Sam. Today is very hot. The sun is very strong. I am hot. I want to be cool. How can I get cool? Wait...I know! I can go to the pool. The pool is cool. I can swim in the pool. Is the pool open? Or is the pool closed? Where is the phone? I need to call the pool. I need to find out if the pool is open or closed. — Ring! Ring! — “Hello. My name is Andrea. I am at the pool. Can I help you?” “Hi, Andrea. Is the pool open?” "Yes. The pool is open." “Okay. Thank you!” “You are welcome. Bye!” Great! The pool is open! Now I can cool down!
