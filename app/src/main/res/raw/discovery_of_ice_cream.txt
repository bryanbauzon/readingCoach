DISCOVERY OF ICE-CREAM	"Frozen Desserts started with the early Greece and Romans. Their slaves added honey and fruit flavors to snow. Marco Polo discovered such ices in the Orient. The chilled desserts of southern Europe travelled to France and England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and later to colonial America. 

The first ice-cream factory in the United States began production in 1851. But as late as 1890 ice cream was still manufactured commercially by a hand-cranked freezer, a device that a woman invented in 1846. 

The ice-cream soda was created in 1874. A man selling flavored carbonated water ran out of sweet cream. He borrowed ice cream from a drugstore, intending to let it melt before adding it to the fizzing water. But the demand for thirst quenchers was too great. So he served the drink with a solid lump of ice cream in it. He was an instant success. 

An unknown “soda jerk” discovered the sundae. Local laws prevented the mixing of sodas on Sunday. So this hero combined ice cream and syrup-without the carbonation-and called it a “Sunday.”
