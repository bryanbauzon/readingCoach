When I sit alone in silence and remember the past, I get depressed about all the things I don’t have
that I once strived for, and I add to old griefs new tears for all the valuable time I’ve wasted. Then I
can drown my eyes, which are not usually wet from crying, in tears for precious friends who are
dead, and I can weep again for hurts in loves that are long since over and moan about the loss of
many things I’ll never see again. Then I can grieve about grievances I had let go of and sadly
recount each woe that I’d already cried about in the past, feeling the pain all over again, as if I hadn’t
suffered over these things already. But if I think about you, my dear friend, while I’m doing all of this,
I get back everything I’d lost, and all my sorrows end.
