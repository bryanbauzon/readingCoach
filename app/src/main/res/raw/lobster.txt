Lobsters are a kind of ocean creature called crustaceans. Crabs and shrimp are crustaceans too. Lobsters, and most other crustaceans, are found throughout the world's oceans, often under rocks or in cracks on the sea floor. Lobsters have five pairs of legs, three of which are claws. The front claws, sometimes called pincers, are larger than the others. Scientists believe lobsters can live up to 70 years! People love to eat lobsters! The state of Maine is famous for the lobsters found along its Atlantic coast. Here, lobsters are often served with melted butter, corn on the cob, and French fries. Did you know that lobsters only turn red after they are cooked? In the wild they can be grayish, yellow, green, blue or multi-colored.
