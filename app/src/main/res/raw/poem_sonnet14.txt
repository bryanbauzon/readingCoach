I don’t base my judgments on the stars, and yet it does seem to me I know astrology. I can’t foresee
good or bad events—predict plagues, famines, or what a season will be like. Nor can I predict down
to the minute what each person’s misfortunes are going to be. Nor can I tell princes whether things
will go well for them by looking at the heavens. But I can forecast the future by looking in your eyes. I
see by those reliable guides that truth and beauty will thrive if you would only pass your attributes on
to a child. Otherwise, this is what I predict: When you die, truth and beauty will die with you.
