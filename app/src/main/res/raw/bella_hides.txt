"Bella is hiding. She is behind the sofa with her pet puppy, Sir. Bella is hiding from her mom. She does not
want to go to the doctor. "Bella?" calls Bella"s mom in a sweet voice. "Where are you?" Bella"s mom
looks in the closet. She looks in the kitchen. She looks next to the bookcase. Bella always hides when she
is scared. Bella is very quiet. Sir begins to jump around behind the sofa. Bella"s mom hears the noise. She
looks behind the sofa with a smile. She holds out her hand. "Don"t be scared," says Bella"s mom. "The
doctor just wants to check your ears." "Will I have to get a shot?" asks Bella. "No," says her mom. That
makes Bella feel better. Bella grabs her mom"s hand. They go to see the doctor."
