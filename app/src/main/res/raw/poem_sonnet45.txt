The other two elements, weightless air and purifying fire, both remain with you, wherever I
may be. Air is my thoughts, and fire is my desire. The two of them slide back and forth between
us swiftly and effortlessly. Normally I am made up of all four elements, but when my air and fire
are off on their errand of love to you, I sink into depression and slide toward death, until air and
fire return to restore the proper balance within me. Even now, they have returned from you to
tell me that youâ€™re well and in good health. I rejoice to hear this but then immediately grow
gloomy from missing you, so I send them back to you and immediately grow sad again.
