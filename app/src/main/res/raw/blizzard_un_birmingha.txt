BLIZZARD UN BIRMINGHA	"The Turner kids were not accustomed to snow. The most they ever got in their southern city of
Birmingham was an inch or so per year. Even that was quite infrequent—it never snowed more than
once or twice each winter. And on the few occasions that it did snow, it was always too warm for the
snow to accumulate. The temperature almost never got below freezing. What was funny was that even
the slightest bit of snow was enough to cancel school and close businesses. No one knew how to drive in
the stuff. It was never enough for young Lily Mae Turner, though, because the snow that came was
always too sparse to build a snowman or to go sledding. But one night, in March of 1993, something
magical happened. An unexpected blast of cold air from Canada and moist air from the Caribbean
converged on the eastern part of the United States to create the “Storm of the Century.” All that the
Turner kids knew was that when they woke up Saturday morning, there was 17 inches of unbelievable
snow on their front lawn and as far as the eye could see. The Turner parents were in shock. Most folks in
town were ill-prepared for such a storm. They had no shovels to dig their way out and no salt to keep
from slipping. They had no idea what to do. While the adults seemed paralyzed with disbelief, the
Turner kids set about having the time of their lives. Lily Mae discovered that a rope tied to a metal trash
can lid made a perfect sled. John Henry figured out that if he put his feet in plastic grocery bags before
putting on his rain boots, his feet stayed warm for a longer time. Rachel made snow angels in every part
of the yard. Together, all the kids made a huge snowman and dressed it in their dad’s hat and jacket.
(Mr. Turner didn’t own a scarf!) For three straight days, the Turner kids had a splendid time. On
Tuesday, the temperature hit 70 degrees, and life for these Southerners went back to normal."	Susan Carter
