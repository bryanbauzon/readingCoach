I won’t believe my mirror when it tells me I’m old, as long as you’re still young. But when I see you
with wrinkles, then I’ll know death is on its way, because your beauty is as close to my heart as
beautiful clothing to a body. Put another way, my heart beats in your chest and yours in mine. But if
that’s true, then how can I be older than you? Therefore, my love, take care of yourself just as I will
take care of myself, not for my own sake, but because I have your heart inside of me, which I will
protect as carefully as a nurse her baby. Don’t expect to get your heart back from me when mine is
dead. You gave it to me forever, never to be returned.
