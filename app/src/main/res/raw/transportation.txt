Modern transportation has given us oranges to eat, squeeze and gulp almost anytime we like. But it wasnï¿½t always so. Not long ago oranges were hardly ever seen by most people. At one time the rich and their portraits pointed showing them holding an orange. Oranges were thought a proper treat at the theatre. Oranges are believed to have came from southern China. Arabs took them to southern Africa and Spain. Spaniards took thorn to North America. In 1873 Mrs. Eliza Tibbits decided to plant oranges in Riverside, California. The U.S. government helped her. It gave her two small trees from Brazil. Branches from these trees were later used to begin the first navel orange graves in California. Some of these branches still grow fruit. An old orange tree still stands in Riverside. It has lived for more than a hundred years.
