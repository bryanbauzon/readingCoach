"African families use peanuts in a number of dishes. Peanuts may be found in soups, stews, and cakes. And nearly all the West African children have some peanuts in their pockets. In Upper Volta children make bracelets out of peanuts. The bracelets are called kura kura. To make them, children boil raw peanuts and mash them. Next they press out the oil and add a little water, corn flour, and honey. Then they roll this mixture into bracelets. Last, they fry the bracelets 1n peanut oil and let them harden.
When the children go out to play, they put a dozen kura kura bracelets on each arm. They can slide one off whenever they are hungry. The name kura kura comes from the sound the children make as they chew the bracelets.
