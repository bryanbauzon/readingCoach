HALLOWEEN"	"The word Halloween is short for ""Allhallows Evening”, “hallow” means “holy.” The evening gets its name because the next day, November 1, is a religious festival day called All Saints’ Day. The things we do to celebrate Halloween today have little to do with religion. All of our Halloween customs have come down to us from the early British, who celebrated the New Year at that season. In that time October 31 was the last day of the year there. It was a time for fun much like the fun we now have on New Year’s Eve. On the night of October 31. All the spooky people of the night were supposed to be about. The black cat, being the traditional companion of witches, is always present on Halloween. The pumpkin is simply a symbol of the harvest. Stealing gates, garbage cans, and chairs--a 21 popular Halloween prank until recently--was a relic of the time when gates and gateposts disappeared and were said to have been stolen by evil spirits. According to tradition, everything connected with the festive evening smacks of the supernatural.
