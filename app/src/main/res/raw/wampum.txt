"Most people think money is important. They need it. They use it to buy things.
Once there were people who had never heard of money. They lived in North America when the white
settlers came. They were the first Americans. The settlers called them Indians.
The Indians didn't buy or sell things. They had no use for money.
But they had something that they thought was important. They had special beads. Their name for the
beads was wampum. The settlers called them wampum. The beads were made of shells. Some beads
were white. Some were dark blue. Some were black. They were like tiny tubes. It took great skill to make
them. It took a long time.
Each bead had to be shaped by hand. Two tools were used. One was a rough stone. One was a sharp
piece of wood.
The beads meant many things to the Indians. They meant high rank. Chiefs wore strings of the beads.
They wore bead belts.
The beads meant truth. They meant a promise. A tribe would give another tribe a bead belt. If the
beads were white or blue, they meant peace. That peace would last. lfthe beads were red, they meant
war. War would come.
The Indians did not buy or sell things. But they gave gifts. A gift meant goodwill. It meant respect. The
beads were the best gift.
The settlers saw how much the beads meant to the Indians. They saw the beads used as gifts. So they
thought the beads were money.
The settlers began to make wampum. They made it fast. They made a great deal of it. They planned to
use it to buy land.
But the Indians did not think land could be owned. They thought it could be used by all.
The settlers did not know this. They gave wampum to the Indians. The Indians thought it was a gift. The
settlers thought they had bought land.
Neither group understood what the other thought. They had been friends. They became enemies.
Now wampum is one word for money. It's a joke, like calling money 'bread.' But once wampum meant
much, much more."
