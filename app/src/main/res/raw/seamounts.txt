SEAMOUNTS	"Did you know that there are mountains named for Mozart, Chopin, and other composers? These mountains are seldom seen, except by fish and divers. for they are under the sea. 
The discovery of a seamount is always big news. If the mount is not too far underwater, scientists like to examine it. Seamounts are of interest because they are thought to be the oldest geographic features on earth.
But there is a more important reason for finding seamounts. They're more dangerous than the highest land mountain. Large seamounts can affect the action of waves in their area. And if they are not far enough under the water, they are a danger to ships. So the position of a new seamount is soon put on all sea maps and charts.
