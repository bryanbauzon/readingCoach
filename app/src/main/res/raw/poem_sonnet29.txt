When I’m in disgrace with everyone and my luck has deserted me, I sit all alone and cry about the
fact that I’m an outcast, and bother God with useless cries, which fall on deaf ears, and look at
myself and curse my fate, wishing that I had more to hope for, wishing I had this man’s good looks
and that man’s friends, this man’s skills and that man’s opportunities, and totally dissatisfied with the
things I usually enjoy the most. Yet, as I’m thinking these thoughts and almost hating myself, I
happen to think about you, and then my condition improves—like a lark at daybreak rising up and
leaving the earth far behind to sing hymns to God. For when I remember your sweet love, I feel so
wealthy that I’d refuse to change places even with kings.
