SEEING STARS	"Yana is my mother. Tony is my father. My name is Sasha. We live in a red house. We have a blue car. We
sit in the yard at night. We look at the stars. Father says the stars make him happy. Mother says the
stars make her want to sing. I like to think about how many stars are in the sky. We hear a baby cry next
door. My mother sings. The baby stops crying. We think he heard my mother’s pretty song. We all smile."	Susan Carter
