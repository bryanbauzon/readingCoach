My name is Olaf. I live in a big city. I live on a busy road. During the day and at night, cars go by. Buses go by. Trucks go by. People do not seem to hear the noise during the day. But at night, the noise makes it hard to sleep. My road has a lot of animals, too. People keep their animals outside in their yards at night. There are cats. There are dogs. The dogs make a lot of noise. To me, the dogs are like the trucks. The dogs are like the cars. The dogs are like the buses. All of them are loud! One dog barks more than the others do. His name is Simba. Simba is Mr. Cheek’s dog. “That is a very bad dog. He keeps me up at night,” says Mr. Lucas. Mr. Lucas lives next door to Mr. Cheek. “You should give him away,” says Mr. Lucas. This makes Mr. Cheek very mad. "You should not sleep with your windows open," says Mr. Cheek. "You should take your dog inside at night," yells Mr. Lucas. The two men argue about Simba’s barking almost every day. I think this is funny. To me, Simba is as bad as the cars. He is as bad as the buses. He is as bad as the trucks. This is what living in a big city is like. There is a lot of noise.
