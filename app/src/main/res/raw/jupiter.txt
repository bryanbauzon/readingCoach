JUPITER	Jupiter is the 5th planet from the sun. It is the largest planet in the solar system. It is so large that all of the other planets combined could fit inside Jupiter. Jupiter is one of the “Gas Giants.” This means you could not stand on Jupiter because it has no surface. Jupiter is known for its Great Red Spot. This is an area of Jupiter with raging storms way more powerful than any on Earth. Scientists don’t know why it is red. They do know that winds inside the spot blow twice as fast as any racecar on Earth can drive.	Alice Munro
