In America the red bamboo been a familiar sight since the early 1800s. But why have barn always been painted red? Why not green or blue or yellow?

A painted barn was an unusual eight before the 1800s, because paint was considered an unnecessary expense. Then farmers realized that exposure to the elements ruined wooden buildings. Thus barn painting began. To save money, moot farmers mixed paint from ingredients already on hand. A mixture was usually created from skimmed milk, lime, and glue made from cows' hooves. To add color, ingredients like animals' blood, roots, and grasses were tried. None of those materials, however, successfully colored the paint. Eventually one fanner used iron oxide as a coloring agent and it worked. Iron oxide gave the paint a reddish'brown tone. Thus, the red barn was born. Later scientists discovered that the color red absorbed the sun's rays. That kept the barn cooler in summer and warmer in winter. Today cooling and heating systems have made the color red less important for barns, but barns are still often red. They have become a farm tradition.
