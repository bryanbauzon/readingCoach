	"One day there was an argument between the wind and the sun. Both said they were stronger than the other. They saw a man traveling on the road and decided to make a test to see which was stronger and able to get the man�s coat off.
The wind began to blow and blow very hard. He nearly ripped the coat from the man�s back but the man grabbed the coat and wrapped it even more tightly around himself and kept going. The wind got tired because the man just kept his coat on. 
Then the sun tried. He shone brightly and the clouds disappeared. Soon the air was warm and dry and the sun kept on shining. Soon the man had sweat running down his face. He was so hot that he finally took off his coat and carried it, looking for a shady spot to rest.
