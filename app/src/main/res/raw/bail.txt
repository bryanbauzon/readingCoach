	"The phone rang at Pratt Taylor"s house at nearly three in the morning. Pratt fumbled for the phone in
the dark. He answered groggily after the fourth ring. "Hello," Pratt mumbled into the receiver. "Mr.
Taylor. Thank goodness. I need your help." Pratt knew the voice, for sure. But still drowsy, he could not
quite place it. "Mr. Taylor!" the man said again in a raspy, loud whisper. "I am in jail. I was allowed one
phone call. I"m calling you." Then, the fog cleared. Although nearly ten years had passed since their last
encounter, Pratt was able to discern something familiar in this voice. It belonged to a boy named Martin
Hall, easily one of the most brilliant math students he had ever taught. But while Pratt recalled that
Martin possessed an enviable aptitude for math, he also had a knack for getting into trouble. Still, they
had forged a strong student-teacher bond, and when Martin graduated from Linebrook High School,
Pratt had told him, "Call me if there is anything you ever need." So here it was " the call in the middle of
the night. "Yes, Martin. Is that you?" "Yes, Mr.Taylor. Can you help?" "What do you need?" "Bail
money." "What did you do?" "We"ll talk about that later. Can you get me one thousand bucks?" Pratt
knew he could, but he was hesitant. What had Martin done? What was Pratt getting himself into?
Pratt"s belief in honoring his word determined his decision. "Yes, I can. Where shall I bring it?" "I"m at
Jessup in Maryland. My brother will come by your place in the morning. Give the money to him, and he
will come and bail me out." "Okay." Upon hanging up the phone, Pratt was overcome by a dreadful
feeling " his intuition told him that the decision to bail Martin out would be one that would vex him for a
very, very long time."
