I’m not like that other poet who writes about a woman who’s pretty because she wears a lot of
makeup. In his verses, he compares her to heaven itself, and to every other beautiful thing—the sun
and moon, the rich gems of earth and sea, the first flowers of April, and all the rest of the precious
things on the face of the earth. Since I reallyam in love, I just want to write the truth, and when I do,
believe me—my lover is as beautiful as any human being, though maybe not as bright as the stars.
Whoever actually likes those love-poem clichés can say more; I’m not trying to sell anything, so I
won’t waste time with praise.
