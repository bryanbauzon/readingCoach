THE INTERVIEW	"Jethro gets ready for his job interview. He takes a shower. He shaves. He brushes his teeth. He cuts his
fingernails. He combs his hair. He puts on the new suit he bought just for today. Jethro feels confident.
He is also very nervous. Here is why. Jethro graduated at the top of his class in college. Still, Jethro
knows the economy is bad. His dad just lost his job at the bank a few weeks ago! Many people are
interviewing for the very same job. There is a lot of competition. Jethro is still positive. He thinks he has
a good chance of getting the job at the technology company. Jethro arrives at his interview at 9:45. He is
15 minutes early. He realizes the importance of being prompt. He does not want to be late. “Have a
seat. Mr. Stone will be right with you,” the receptionist says. Jethro sits. He thinks about what he has
learned to do in an interview. Look people in the eye. Give a firm handshake. Speak clearly. Jethro feels
ready. “Mr. Stone is ready to see you now,” the receptionist says. Jethro takes a deep breath and walks
into Mr. Stone’s office. “Good to meet you, sir,” Jethro says and gives Mr. Stone a firm handshake and a
smile."	Susan Carter
