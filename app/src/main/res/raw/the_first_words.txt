	"Linnette loved parrots. Linnette"s Aunt Fern had a big green parrot named Maud. Aunt Fern lived a long
way off, so Linnette had visited her only once. That was when she met Maud. Maud had looked at
Linnette for a long time. Then Maud had said, "Hi, there! You"re my pal!" When Linnette got home, all
she talked about was the parrot Maud. She began to save pictures of parrots. She read about parrots.
And she wanted a parrot of her own. Every day at breakfast Linnette said, "Good morning. I wish I had a
parrot." At bedtime she said, "Good night. I wish I had a parrot." At last Linnette"s father said, "Why
not? You"re beginning to sound like a parrot. Maybe if you have one, you"ll think of something new to
say." So he went to the pet shop. When he came back, he had two parrots. "Meet Roy and Belle," he
said. "The man at the pet shop said they are a pair. They"re good friends. He didn"t want to sell just one.
So he made me a good price for the two." Linnette was delighted! She began to try to teach them to
talk. She"d say "Hi, there!" to Roy. Roy would look at her. Then he"d turn to Belle and say "Squawk,
squawk! Squawk ?&quot; And Belle would squawk back. Then Linnette would say "Hi, there!" to Belle. Belle
would look at her. Then she"d squawk at Roy. They talked to each other all day, but they wouldn"t talk to
Linnette. Linnette read in her parrot book that parrots prefer to talk to other parrots. But if there is only
one parrot, it will talk to people. So Linnette asked her father to get another cage. She put Belle in it.
Then she put the cage in the kitchen. Roy stayed in Linnette"s room. Now, Linnette thought, Roy and
Belle will talk to me! And she was right. One day Roy looked at her. Then he spoke his first words. He
said, "Squawk! Where"s Belle? Where"s Belle?" Then Linnette went to the kitchen, and Belle spoke her
first words. She said, "Squawk! Where"s Roy? Where"s Roy?""
