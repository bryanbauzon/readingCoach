In the early 1800, sailors returning from a long time at sea were often weak or ill. They had not been getting enough good food on board their ship. Unlike today, there was no way to keep fruits, vegetables, and meat fresh. In just a few days most food spoiled and had to be thrown away. The sailors then ate only dried rice and beans. This was not the right kind of food to keep them strong. Luckily, Nicholas Appert decided to do something about this. He worked at the problem for a year. Then. in 1811, he invented a way of canning food. Food could now be kept a long time, and sailors could enjoy their meals at sea.
