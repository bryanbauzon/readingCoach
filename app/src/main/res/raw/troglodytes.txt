TROGLODYTES	"People have always been fascinated by caves and many have lived in them. Cave dwellers are called troglodytes, from a Greek word meaning “one who creeps into holes.” In France today there are whole villages of troglodytes. Roche l'Eveque, in the valley of the Loire, is a troglodyte community that has been occupied for as long as anyone can remember. The cave dwellers are ordinary people--farmers, winegrowers, end merchants--who simply prefer living in caves to living in houses. At first inspection the houses don’t even appear to be caves. They are in the face of a cliff and the cave dwellers have constructed house fronts on them. At Haute-Isle, near Paris, there is another colony of cave dwellers. Their ancestors lived there, and each generation has made improvements. Grandfather, perhaps, excavated another room or added a window. Father added a stateroom and a fireplace whose 
chimney, of course, went up through the ceiling. But troglodytes must be careful, when making a hole in the root, not to disturb the vegetable garden--for, after all, the roof is the ground!
