VET EMERGENCY	"It is 10:00 on a Saturday night. The doors to the animal emergency room fly open. Cyrus carries a tiny,
black lab puppy into the building. ""Save him. Please!"" cries Cyrus. ""He ran out into the street and got hit
by a car.&quot; The puppy is whining. There is a lot of blood. Dr. Williams comes from behind the desk. She
reads the puppy’s name tag. “Here, let me take Lobo from you,” Dr. Williams tells Cyrus gently. “I will
take him in the back for x-rays and see what needs to be done.” When Dr. Williams gets to the back, she
takes a closer look at Lobo. Her face is grim. She can see the dog's leg is broken badly. She fears there is
other damage she cannot see. The assistants in the room are silent. Everyone knows that Lobo may not
survive. If he does survive, his leg injury may be so severe that walking will be hard for him to do. The x-
rays show that Lobo’s front leg has been broken in three places. He is also bleeding inside. Dr. Williams
gets to work. She knows she must stop the bleeding quickly. The surgery takes just under two hours. Dr.
Williams fixes the damage to Lobo's leg. She stops the bleeding inside his chest. “I will go tell Lobo’s
owner that this little pup is going to make it,” Dr. Williams says. “We’ll see in a few weeks how well he
will walk again.”"	Susan Carter
