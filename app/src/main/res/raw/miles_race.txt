500 MILES RACE	
People at the 1912 Indianapolis 500 automobile race were certain that Ralph DePalma would win.
 He had led for most of the 500-mile (BM-kilometer) race. Only a disaster could stop him from winning.  
Then it happened. Going into the last lap, his car suddenly stopped. DePalma jumped out and began to push it. 
As he pushed, cars whizzed by at speeds of 160 km/h (100 mph). But he did not seem to mind.
 He slowly made his war toward the finish line.
 DePalmas car crossed the line just before Joe Dawson, the man in second place, roared past. 
But the prize went to Dawson. There is a rule that the winning car has to cross the finish line under its own power.
