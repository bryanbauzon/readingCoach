Mount Vesuvius is an active volcano located just east of Naples, Italy. It is the only volcano on the continent of Europe to have erupted in the last 100 years, though other volcanoes have erupted on islands in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1631, approximately 3,000 people were killed by an eruption from Mount Vesuvius. Since 1631, the 4,200-foot-high volcano has erupted at least 21 times. Mount Vesuvius is considered particularly dangerous because today, nearly 3 million people live in the direct path of a potential future eruption. Mount Vesuvius is most famous for its landmark eruption in the year 79 AD, which buried the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in layers of burning ash. The only account of the eruption that survives is from Pliny the Younger. From his dramatic account, scientists believe the cloud of ash he witnessed that descended upon Pompeii was 20 miles high. The city of Pompeii was completely buried. It was rediscovered in 1748, more than 1,600 years after the eruption. The people of Pompeii were found buried under 12 layers of soil. Many of the buildings were amazingly well preserved, as were the bodies of those who were just going about their daily routines when the eruption occurred. The ruins at Pompeii have provided archaeologists with valuable information about how people in the Roman Empire lived. Today, Pompeii is one of the most visited sites in Italy.
