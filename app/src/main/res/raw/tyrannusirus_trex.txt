TYRANNOSAURUS REX
By Thomas North

The Tyrannosaurus rex, also known as T. rex, was one of the largest land predators to have ever lived. The T. rex could grow to 40 feet in length (a little longer than a school bus) and could stand 13 feet tall at the hips (about three feet taller than a basketball hoop). It lived in what is now western North America and may have even been partly covered in feathers. The Tyrannosaurus rex was a fearsome predator with strong jaws and up to 60 teeth. Some of these teeth could grow to be almost a foot long. The T. rex was a strict carnivore (meat eater) and hunted other dinosaurs. Scientists aren’t sure how fast the T. rex could run, or if it could even run at all. In 1990, a fossil hunter found the most complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex ever found! It was sold to a museum for eight million dollars, the highest amount ever paid for dinosaur fossils
