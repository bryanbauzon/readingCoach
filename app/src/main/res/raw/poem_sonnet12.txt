When I look at the clock and notice time ticking away, and see splendid day sink into hideous night;
when I see the violet wilt and curly black hair turn white with age; when I see tall trees that once
provided shade for herds now barren of leaves, and the summer’s crops tied up and hauled to the
barn as if summer itself were an old man being carried off to his grave—then I have doubts about
the fate of your beauty, since you too will have to undergo the ravages of time. Sweet and beautiful
creatures don’t stay that way; they die as fast as they see others grow. And there’s no defense
against Time’s destructive power, except perhaps to have children—to defy Time when he takes you
away.
