"As a girl, Louisa Bethune showed great promise in planning houses and various other structures. As an adult, she was determined to become America�s first woman architect. Young architects then usually learned their skills by working in the drafting rooms of professional architects. Most architects didn�t want to employ women. But Louise convinced a well-known architect to give her a chance. She worked from six in the morning to six in the evening. She wasn�t paid much. But she learned as she worked, and her employer allowed her to use his large library. In 1881, after five years of work and study, Louise set up her own office. She advertised that �the first professional woman architect in the country was ready for business.� Louise insisted that she would not be limited to designing private homes just because she was a woman. She sought out a variety of jobs and designed chapels, storage buildings, factories, and schools. She did very well, inspiring other women to become architects. She often spoke out for fair treatment for women and equal pay for equal work.
