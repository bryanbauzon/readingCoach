Look in your mirror and tell the face you see that it’s time to father a child. Your face is fresh and
healthy now, but if you don’t reproduce it, you’ll be cheating the world and cursing a woman who
would happily be your child’s mother. After all, do you think there’s a woman out there so beautiful
that she’d refuse to have your child? And what man would be so foolish as to allow his own self-
absorption to stop himself from fathering children? You are like a mirror to your own mother, and
when she looks at you she can gaze back at the lovely springtime of her youth. In the same way,
when you are old and wrinkled, you’ll be able to look at your child and see yourself in your prime. But
if you choose not to have a child to remember you, you’ll die alone and leave no memory of your
own image.
