"The wasp is a little creature that's a very unpopular insect, but it's also very interesting. In spring the queen locates a protected area and begins constructing a grey, papery nest. The building material is soft, weathered pieces of wood, which she munches into a sticky pulp. The nest has cells, similar to those in a beehive, and the queen deposits an egg in each cell. When the eggs hatch, the queen goes hunting insects for her babies' food. As the first wasp babies mature, they become workers and hunt flies or make paper to enlarge the nest so that the queen can remain at home and lay eggs. The last wasps of the season to be hatched are kings and queens, and they are royally attended by the workers. The first frost kills the workers, and the helpless kings crawl off and starve. The queens, however, migrate to a warm, secluded place and sleep until springtime, when their work begins again.
