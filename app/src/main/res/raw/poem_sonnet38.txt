How could I lack things to write about while you’re alive? You pour inspiration into my poetry by
giving me the sweetest subject to write about: yourself—too excellent a subject for ordinary writers to
describe. Oh, give yourself the credit if you see anything in my writing that’s worth reading. For who
is so speechless that he can’t write to you, when you yourself provide the creative spark? You
should be the tenth muse, worth ten times more than those other nine invoked by poets. And
whoever calls on you for inspiration, let him write eternal verses, to outlive even the farthest reaches
of time. If my little bit of inspiration happens to please today’s demanding readers, the painful work
can be mine, but the praise shall be yours.
