	"Mr. Glen was driving his car down a busy city street. There was a big van in front of him. Suddenly the
van began to go faster. Its back door flew open, and out fell a big white pig! The&#39; poor pig landed on its
back with its feet in the air. It just lay there.
'Oh, dear,' Mr. Glen said. 'I hope it's not hurt.'
He got out of his car and ran up to the pig.
'Are you all right?' he asked. The pig didn't answer. Its eyes were closed. Mr. Glen patted the pig on its
fat tummy. In a minute the pig opened its eyes.
'That's better,' Mr. Glen said.
He helped the pig to roll over, and it stood up. Mr. Glen looked for the van, but it had gone.
Meanwhile, of course, a lot of other cars had stopped. There was a bad traffic jam. Some drivers were
honking. Some were yelling at Mr. Glen. Some were shouting, 'Get that pig out of here!' Some were
calling him bad names. He began to feel quite upset.
But the pig could walk; so Mr. Glen helped it into the front seat of his car. The pig sat there, looking out
of the window. The other drivers were still honking and yelling. Just as Mr. Glen was about to drive
away, a police officer came up to him. The officer looked very angry.
'What do you think you're doing, causing a mess, like this?' he asked. 'Why have you got that pig in
your car?'
'I'm sorry,' Mr. Glen said. 'He fell out of a van and it drove off. I don't know what to do with him.'
'Take him to the zoo,' said the officer. 'NOW! Get moving!'
The officer blew his whistle. Mr. Glen and the pig drove away.
The next day, at just about the same time, Mr. Glen was driving down the same street. Once again other
cars all around him were honking their horns. Some of the drivers were laughing and yelling.
Mr. Glen stopped at a traffic light, and there was the same officer. The officer looked at Mr. Glen's car to
see why all the other cars were honking. There in the front seat was the white pig!
The officer came over to Mr. Glen. He was angry again.
'I thought I told you to take that pig to the zoo!' he shouted.
'Oh, yes, you did, officer,' said Mr. Glen happily. 'Thank you very much. We went and we both had a
wonderful time! And today we're going to the park and the Natural History Museum!'
The pig said Oink and the two of them drove away."
