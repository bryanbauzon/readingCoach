Those charming little infidelities that you commit when I’m away from you for awhile are
understandable given your youth and beauty, since you’re continually tempted wherever you go.
You’re noble and distinguished, so women see you as a prize catch. You’re beautiful, and therefore
women pursue you aggressively. And when a woman is the pursuer, what man will rudely refuse her
to get his point across? But, oh my—you might at least stay away from my mistress and keep your
beauty and youthful urges in line, as they’re leading you into debauchery, which breaks two bonds:
my mistress’s fidelity to me, which your beauty tempts her to break, and your bond with me, which
your beauty, again, lets you break.
