CORN	"Corn is the most popular crop in the United States. More than half the corn in the US is grown in Iowa,
Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota. The state of Iowa grows the most. Corn grows almost everywhere.
China, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, India and France grow lots of corn, but the US grows the most. Corn is
an important food in many countries. People use corn flour, called cornmeal, to make baked foods.
People also eat cornflakes. At first, people ate cornflakes only in the United States. Now people eat
cornflakes all over the world. Some corn is made into popcorn. The corn pops into light fluffy pieces
filled with air. People can eat popcorn as a snack. People in the U.S. like to eat corn on the cob. Some
people eat corn as a side dish or in salads. Corn syrup is a very sweet liquid. Companies use it to make
foods taste sweet. Some people even make beer from corn. In the US, farmers grow corn for their
animals to eat. Cows and pigs eat corn. Some companies put corn into food for other animals. For
example, some companies put corn in dog food. In Europe, people use corn as fish bait, called “dough
balls.” They use corn to catch fish. Some gas companies make fuel for cars and trucks from corn. The fuel
is ethanol. Some companies add ethanol to gas. Gas with ethanol is cheaper than other gas."	Susan Carter
