Take all my loves, my love—yes, take them all: Take my love for you, take away your love for me,
and take a lover from me. What do you have now that you didn’t have before? My love, you haven’t
acquired true love, because my true love was yours to begin with, before you took this extra from
me. If, instead of accepting my love, you make love to the person, love, I can’t blame you, because
you’re only taking advantage of my love. But, you should be blamed if you deceive yourself by taking
from one person what you won’t take from another—if you willingly make love to one person while
refusing to make love to me. I forgive you for stealing from me, gentle thief, although you’re taking
the little I have. And yet every lover knows that it hurts more to be injured by a lover than by an
enemy. You, who are gracious even when succumbing to lust, you in whom everything bad looks
good—even if you kill me with injuries, let’s not become enemies.
