BULLIED	"Bryan doesn't like going to school anymore. He is tired of being bullied. Some of the bigger boys at
school are mean to him. They push him to the ground. They hide his books. They call him names. They
are bullies. When things get really bad, Bryan tells his mom he is sick. “You should stay home and rest,”
Mom says. “You&#39;ll feel better tomorrow.” Then Bryan gets to stay home. He reads books. He watches
television. He eats what he wants. He is not scared. “You should tell someone you are getting bullied at
school,” says Bryan’s best friend, Link. But Bryan is scared. He doesn&#39;t want to tell an adult. “That will
make things worse, Link,” says Bryan. “You don’t go to my school. You have no idea how mean these
guys can be.” “You can’t keep missing school,” says Link. “Your grades will fall. You will be in trouble at
home. And besides, you don&#39;t want to be in the seventh grade forever, do you?&quot; Bryan thinks Link is
probably right. He will tell his mom about the bullies when she gets home from work tonight. He will see
what happens."	Susan Carter
