"In 1760, a man named Tiphaigne de la Roche made a bizarre prediction. In an imaginary story called
Giphantie, mirror images of scenes from nature could be captured permanently on a canvas covered
with a sticky material. After the material dried in darkness, the image would remain on the canvas
forever. At the time, the idea was unheard of. It was not until the following century that the concept of
photography was born, starting with some experiments by Nic'phore Ni'pce. Nic'phore Ni'pce, who
was a French inventor, was interested in lithography, which is a printmaking technique. He was
experimenting with lithography when he found a way of copying etchings onto glass and pewter plates
using a chemical that changes when it is exposed to light. He learned to burn images onto the plates and
then print the images on paper. He shared his findings with Louis Jacques Mand' Daguerre, who
improved the process and announced it to the French Academy of Sciences in 1839. The Daguerreotype,
the photography method named after Daguerre, met with great success. It was so successful, in fact,
that French newspapers said the French public had an illness called Daguerreotypomania!
Daguerreotypes were inexpensive and were suitable for portraiture. People called the Daguerreotype a
'mirror with a memory.' Some portrait artists went out of business when Daguerreotypes came into
vogue. Others became Daguerreotypists, now known as photographers. Photography took off and today
includes You Tube fans, I'Reporters, and everybody with a cell phone camera. Today photography
captures life around the globe. The bizarre prediction of Mr. de le Roche has come true, and then some.
But how was the prediction of mirror-image pictures made in the first place? Was de la Roche's
prediction of mirror-image photography just a lucky guess? Or was the Daguerreotype a picture-perfect
case of life imitating art?"	Susan Carter
