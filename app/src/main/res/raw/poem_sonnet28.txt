So how can I return in a cheerful state of mind when I’m prevented from getting any rest? When the
oppression I experience during the day isn’t relieved by any sleep at night, but instead my sleepless
nights oppress me during the day and my wearisome days oppress me at night? And though day
and night are natural enemies, they’ve shook hands and made a bargain to both torture me, the day
with labor, the night with thoughts of how far away you are as I labor over thoughts of you. I try to
please the day by telling him how bright you are—so bright that you take the sun’s place when
clouds cover the sky. In the same way, I use you to flatter black night, telling him how you brighten
the evening sky when stars don’t shine. But they both—day and night—only prolong my sorrows,
and night by night this prolonged grief grows stronger.
