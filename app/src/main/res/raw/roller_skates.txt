"The man credited with inventing roller skates is Joseph Merlin, a Belgian born in 1785. He wore the first known roller skates as part of a costume at a fancy dress party in London. His only problem was that neither the direction nor the speed of the skates could be controlled. Joseph entered the party rolling, but he couldnï¿½t stop or turn. He crashed into a large mirror, smashed it, and wounded himself. As a result, roller-skating went back to being a set of plans.In 1819 a French inventor received a patent for his roller skates. But it was in 1863 that an American, James Plimpton, invented the first skates that could be guided on curves. Since then, skates have been improved. Today, more than 20 million people roller-skate regularly at the more than twenty-five hundred rinks in the United States. There are national contests held yearly in roller hockey and figure, free-style, dance, and speed roller-skating.'1n 1974, roller-skating was accepted by the Pan American Sports Organization. Many people believe there will soon be Olympic roller skating competition.
