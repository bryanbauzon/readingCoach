"Paola and Imran have been married nearly 8 years. They have had many good times together. They have
traveled the world together. They have had two little girls together. They have started a chocolate shop
together. Lately, Paola and Imran have been fighting a lot. Business at the chocolate shop is slow. Imran
thinks it is Paola"s fault. They are having trouble with money. Paola thinks Imran spends too much. One
evening, Paola decides to visit her mom for advice. Paola knocks on her mom"s door. Paola"s mom is
happy. It is a surprise visit. She quickly sees, however, that something is wrong. Paola looks sad and
tired. "Paola, what is the matter?" Mom asks. Paola tells her mom all that is going on. Mom smiles
gently. She rubs Paola"s back. Then she tells Paola a story. "Your father and I have a wonderful marriage.
But we don"t always get along. There was a time when things were very bad between us. We fought all
the time. You were just a little girl. One day we watched you playing on the floor. We knew we wanted
to make our marriage work. We loved you very much. We loved each other very much. We knew we had
to work harder on our marriage." "What did you do?" asks Paola. "We agreed to talk more. We planned
a special night each week for the two of us. We went to see someone who helps people with their
marriages," Mom says. "It was worth it. I can"t imagine not having your father in my life." Paola begins
to feel better. "You are right," she says. "What Imran and I have is worth working for.""
