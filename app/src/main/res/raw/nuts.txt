hazelnuts are nuts. Chestnuts are nuts. Beechnuts are nuts. Acorns are nuts. But, Brazil Nuts are not
nuts. Cashews are not nuts. Peanuts are not nuts. Pistachios are not nuts. So what are nuts? A true nut is
a fruit with one seed. True nuts have very hard shells. True nuts do not open on their own. You must
crack a true nut to open it. Cooks often call seeds “nuts.” In addition, English speakers often call seeds,
“nuts.” The difference between nuts and seeds is small, so it is not necessarily wrong to call a seed a nut.
