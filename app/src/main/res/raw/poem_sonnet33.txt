I’ve seen many beautiful mornings in which the sun beautifies the mountaintops, kissing the
green meadows with its golden face and making streams sparkle as if by magic. But then it
suddenly permits the nastiest clouds to ride across its heavenly face, and it hides from the
forlorn world, sneaking off to the west in disgrace. In exactly this way, early one morning my
sun shone on my face with triumphant splendor, but alas he was only mine for one hour. The
clouds have hidden him from me now. But I don’t fault him for this at all. Golden men like him
can disgrace themselves as much as the real sun does.
