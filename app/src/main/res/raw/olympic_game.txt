OLYMPIC GAME	"Held every four years, the Olympic Games consisted It first, of a single event, a foot race of 180 kilometers (200 yards). But later, more and longer races were added. Then wrestling, jumping, javelin throwing, and boxing were included. Finally, the chariot race was put on the schedule. The games were held in late summer and were completed in one day. After the first three centuries, however, they became so complex that they had to be carried over into a second day and more. At their height, they lasted five days. The games took place in the town of Olympia in southern Greece. They were not, however, named for the town. They were to honor the greatest of the Greek gods, Zeus, who dwelt on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. The games were named for it.
