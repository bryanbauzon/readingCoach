"Locks and keys have been in use for thousands of years. Why? Because there have always been thieves.
In Egypt a lock that is about four thousand years old was found. It works much the same as locks work
today. The old Egyptian locks were made of wood. Large keys were used to open them. These keys were
made of wood too. They looked like big toothbrushes. In Greece, long ago, people had locks and keys.
But they had a hard time taking their keys with them when they left their homes. The keys were too big.
They were so big that they had to be carried on people's backs. Some people left their key with a man
who sat near their front door. He unlocked the door for the family or their friends. But if thieves came,
he used the big key to fight them off. The Romans were the first to make keys of iron. Since that time
most keys have been made of metal. Rich people used to have keys made of gold or silver. Some of
these keys were quite beautiful. In the Middle Ages someone thought of a good way to catch thieves.
A trick lock was used. When a thief broke into a house, he would see a small trunk. It looked as if it held
gold. The thief would open it. Inside was a flat top with five small holes in it. The thief would stick his
fingers through the holes. Then a trap shut on them! The trap held him fast. The thief had to wait until
the person who owned the trunk came to free him. Some people like to save keys. They try to find as
many kinds as they can. And there are many kinds of keys to find. Think of all the things that have locks!
Houses and cars are just two of them. You might like to save keys too. Look for keys that no one wants
anymore. Ask your friends for their old keys. It may open the door to lots of fun."
