THE GREAT BUDDHA	"It has three eyes. It is as tall as a building with four floors. It weighs more than ninety tons. What is it?
The Great Buddha at Kamakura, Japan . The Great Buddha is a huge statue. You can go inside it. You
can climb up and look out a window in its back. It is said that it is the biggest statue of its kind in the
world. The Great Buddha is hundreds of years old. It was made in 1252. That was 240 years before
Columbus reached America. In Europe, it was the time of knights. The real Buddha was a holy man. The
statue is meant to make people think of him. When it was new, it was in a temple. In 1495, a huge wave
swept over the land. The wave knocked the temple down. Not one part of it was left. But the statue was
not harmed. There it sat, under the sky. All the people could see it. It made them feel safe. It has sat
there ever since. Why does it have three eyes? The third eye means that Buddha sees all.
It is just a round dot on the Buddha’s forehead. Other parts of the statue mean things too. It has long
ears. They mean that Buddha hears all. It has a bump on its head. This means that Buddha knows all.
The face looks very calm. The eyes are half closed. This means that Buddha is at peace. The hands are
placed with the thumbs together. This shows faith. There is meaning, too, in the way the statue sits. It is
supposed to help bring calm thoughts.
You can try to sit this way yourself. Sit on the floor. Cross your legs. Your feet should be close to you.
Your knees should be close to the floor. That’s not easy at first, but try. Half close your eyes. Rest your
hands on your lap. Breathe slowly. Try not to think. Sit that way as long as you can.
Do you feel peaceful? Looking at the Great Buddha makes many people feel at peace. So does sitting like
him?"	Susan Carter
