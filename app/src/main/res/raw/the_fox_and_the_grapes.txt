One hot day, a hungry fox made his way to a nearby vineyard. He knew there were plenty of grapes. He could see them plump and juicy and could hardly wait to eat some. However, the vines were too high and he could not reach them no matter what he did. At last, tired from all his trying, he turned away in disgust. "Those grapes are too green and sour for my taste. I would not even eat them if someone gave them to me. Let someone else eat them! I don"t want them.
