I’m like a rich man who has the key to a great treasure chest, but who resists opening it every hour,
because he doesn’t want to spoil his pleasure by getting too used to the treasure. That’s why holiday
feasts are so infrequent: Spaced out across the year, they’re like precious jewels placed evenly
across a crown. In the same way, the time that keeps us apart is my treasure chest, or it’s like a
closet that hides a beautiful robe— the closet makes a special occasion even more special when it is
opened to reveal its hidden splendor. You are blessed with such great worth that those who are with
you feel triumphant, and those who are not with you hope to be.
