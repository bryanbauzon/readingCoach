THE RENT MAN	"Someone is knocking on Amanda’s door. Amanda is home, but she does not answer. It is the man who
owns the house where she lives. His name is Mr. Campbell. Amanda calls him the Rent Man. He has
come by to get the rent money Amanda owes. Amanda does not have the money to pay him. Amanda
lost her job at the auto factory three and a half weeks ago. “I worked there for 15 years,” Amanda thinks
to herself. She is bitter. “But it took them just one day to take my job away.” Amanda has no idea when
she will find another job. Lots of other people from her factory lost their jobs three weeks ago, too. She
looks for work every day. She looks for work at a restaurant. “You have never worked at a restaurant,”
the owner tells her. “This job is not for you.” She looks for work at the bookstore. “We don’t have any
jobs right now,” the clerk tells Amanda. She looks for work at the grocery store. “I will call you to let you
know,” the manager says. Amanda is worried. She is running out of money quickly. There is another loud
knock at the door. Amanda sits quietly in her kitchen. She hopes the Rent Man will go away soon."	Susan Carter
