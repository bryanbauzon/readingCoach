Stagecoaches were introduced in England about 1640. People paid to ride in them. Some travelled on the roof because it was cheaper. (It was more dangerous, too, as there was nothing on top of the coach to hang on to.) These new stagecoaches had teams of horses waiting at different stages of the journey. Thus fresh horses could be used instead of waiting for the horses pulling the coach to rest. A stagecoach could not travel faster than eight kilometers (five miles) an hour. Even so, travelling time was cut down. Later turnpike roads were started. People paid a toll to use the roads, and the money was used to mend the roads. But it wasnï¿½t until about a hundred years ago that English roads improved. Then coaches could travel at thirteen kilometers (eight miles) an hour.
