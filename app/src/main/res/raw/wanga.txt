WANGA	"I, Nancy Norris, believer of nothing, order my spell kit on the Internet. This might sound crazy, but I have
run out of more sane ideas. I have looked in the want ads. I have sent my resume to a million
companies. I have gone to businesses up and down my block asking for work. I need a job. I need
money. I need these things fast. I am desperate. I am about to lose my house. I am about to lose my car.
I have been out of work for 8 months. The Internet is free at the library. This is a very good thing. I see a
site that sells witch doctor spell kits. WARNING: Do not ask for something unless you truly want it to
come true! There are Love Kits. These get someone to love you back. There are New Life Kits. These
make you happy. There are Money Kits. These bring you money, riches and an easy life. Of course, I
choose the Money Kit. This is what I need. I truly want it to come true. I have $20 left on my credit card.
I use it all to order my spell kit. Don’t laugh. I order the kit on Monday. It says it should arrive in two
days. So I wait. Wednesday passes. I wait and wait. Finally it gets here after four days. I am kind of upset
it took so long. I hope it doesn’t take that long for the spell to work. Like a wild animal, I tear open the
box. Inside is the kit with a Wanga doll. The doll has been blessed by an actual witch doctor and is a very
important part of making my spell come true. That is what the box says, anyway. Wanga is about 6
inches tall. He has bushy black hair. He is dressed in a furry outfit that looks like a bathrobe. Hopefully,
he will be my new best friend. There are three different powders in the kit. Each has its own separate
bag. The kit also comes with a set of detailed instructions. I am to follow them exactly. I spread the
powders out on the floor and place my Wanga doll next to them. I hope for the best. My mortgage is
due tomorrow."	Susan Carter
