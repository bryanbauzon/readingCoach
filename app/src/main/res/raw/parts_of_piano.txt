PARTS OF A PIANO	"What happens when a pianist sits down to play the piano? What makes the beautiful sounds we hear? 
A piano has strings and hammers inside it. The strings are different lengths and sizes. There are short, thin strings to make high sounds. And there are tong, thick strings to make low sounds. There is also something called a sounding board-it makes the piano sound deep and rich. 
When you press down on a piano key, levers make a small hammer hit a string. The string vibrates. That makes the sounding board vibrate. The strings and the sounding board vibrate together and make the sounds of music.
