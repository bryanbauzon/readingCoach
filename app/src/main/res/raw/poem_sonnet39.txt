How can I celebrate your worth in my poems without appearing conceited, given that you’re my
better half? What good does it do me to praise myself—and am I doing anything besides praising
myself when I praise you? For this reason, let’s live apart. And though we love each other dearly,
let’s lose our common identity; by this separation, I can give you the praise that you deserve by
yourself. Oh, absence, you would be such a torment if it weren’t for the fact that you give me the
chance to fill up the lonely hours with thoughts of love, which make the time pass so sweetly, and
that you teach me how to divide my love and me in two, as I, here, praise my friend while he remains
elsewhere.
