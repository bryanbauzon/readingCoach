A young mouse returned to his mother after going out of their hole for the very first time. "Mother, I came across two most wonderful animals. One was beautiful and gentle with velvety fur and a fine wavy tail; the other was a frightening monster with pieces of red skin on its head and under its chin that moved with every step it took. Then it let out a terrible sound just as I was going to talk to the kind-looking one."
