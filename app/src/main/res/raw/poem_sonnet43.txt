My eyes work best when I’m asleep, because all day they look at things I don’t care about. When I
sleep, my dreaming eyes alight on you and glitter brightly in the dark, having found your bright image
there. Given that your shadowy dream-image brightens even the dark, how bright might you appear
in daylight, when your own light is so much clearer? How bright, when your shadow shines so
brightly to my eyes blinded by darkness? What good would it do my eyes to see you in the daytime
when they already look at your beautiful image in the dead of night, as I sleep? Every day is as dark
as night until I get to see you again, and every night is as bright as day when I see you in my
dreams.
