I acknowledge that the two of us have to part, even though we’re united in love. That way I can take
those disgraces that we’ve incurred together all onto myself, bearing them without any help from
you. Our love for one another gives us common cause, despite this awful situation that forces us
apart, which, though it can’t prevent us from being united in love, still robs us of sweet hours of
pleasure together. I can never greet you openly again, because my guilt would bring shame upon
you. Nor can you ever honor me with public kindness without dishonoring your own reputation. But
don’t do that. I love you so much that I value your good reputation as my own.
